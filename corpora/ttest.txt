A, as its first of letters, every speech maintains;
The "Primal Deity" is first through all the world's domains.
As the letter A is the first of all letters, so the eternal God is first in the world.

No fruit have men of all their studied lore,
Save they the 'Purely Wise One's' feet adore.
What Profit have those derived from learning, who worship not the good feet of Him who is possessed of pure knowledge ?

His feet, 'Who o'er the full-blown flower hath past,' who gain
In bliss long time shall dwell above this earthly plain.
They who are united to the glorious feet of Him who passes swiftly over the flower of the mind, shall flourish long above all worlds.

His foot, 'Whom want affects not, irks not grief,' who gain
Shall not, through every time, of any woes complain.
To those who meditate the feet of Him who is void of desire or aversion, evil shall never come.

The men, who on the 'King's' true praised delight to dwell,
Affects not them the fruit of deeds done ill or well.
The two-fold deeds that spring from darkness shall not adhere to those who delight in the true praise of God.
