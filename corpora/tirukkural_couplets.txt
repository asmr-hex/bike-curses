A, as its first of letters, every speech maintains;
The "Primal Deity" is first through all the world's domains.


No fruit have men of all their studied lore,
Save they the 'Purely Wise One's' feet adore.


His feet, 'Who o'er the full-blown flower hath past,' who gain
In bliss long time shall dwell above this earthly plain.


His foot, 'Whom want affects not, irks not grief,' who gain
Shall not, through every time, of any woes complain.


The men, who on the 'King's' true praised delight to dwell,
Affects not them the fruit of deeds done ill or well.


Long live they blest, who 've stood in path from falsehood freed;
His, 'Who quenched lusts that from the sense-gates five proceed'.


Unless His foot, 'to Whom none can compare,' men gain,
'Tis hard for mind to find relief from anxious pain.


Unless His feet 'the Sea of Good, the Fair and Bountiful,' men gain,
'Tis hard the further bank of being's changeful sea to attain.


Before His foot, 'the Eight-fold Excellence,' with unbent head,
Who stands, like palsied sense, is to all living functions dead.


They swim the sea of births, the 'Monarch's' foot who gain;
None others reach the shore of being's mighty main.


The world its course maintains through life that rain unfailing gives;
Thus rain is known the true ambrosial food of all that lives.


The rain makes pleasant food for eaters rise;
As food itself, thirst-quenching draught supplies.


If clouds, that promised rain, deceive, and in the sky remain,
Famine, sore torment, stalks o'er earth's vast ocean-girdled plain.


If clouds their wealth of waters fail on earth to pour,
The ploughers plough with oxen's sturdy team no more.


'Tis rain works all: it ruin spreads, then timely aid supplies;
As, in the happy days before, it bids the ruined rise.


If from the clouds no drops of rain are shed.
'Tis rare to see green herb lift up its head.


If clouds restrain their gifts and grant no rain,
The treasures fail in ocean's wide domain.


If heaven grow dry, with feast and offering never more,
Will men on earth the heavenly ones adore.


If heaven its watery treasures ceases to dispense,
Through the wide world cease gifts, and deeds of 'penitence'.


When water fails, functions of nature cease, you say;
Thus when rain fails, no men can walk in 'duty's ordered way'.


The settled rule of every code requires, as highest good,
Their greatness who, renouncing all, true to their rule have stood.


As counting those that from the earth have passed away,
'Tis vain attempt the might of holy men to say.


Their greatness earth transcends, who, way of both worlds weighed,
In this world take their stand, in virtue's robe arrayed.


He, who with firmness, curb the five restrains,
Is seed for soil of yonder happy plains.


Their might who have destroyed 'the five', shall soothly tell
Indra, the lord of those in heaven's wide realms that dwell.


Things hard in the doing will great men do;
Things hard in the doing the mean eschew.


Taste, light, touch, sound, and smell: who knows the way
Of all the five,- the world submissive owns his sway.


The might of men whose word is never vain,
The 'secret word' shall to the earth proclaim.


The wrath 'tis hard e'en for an instant to endure,
Of those who virtue's hill have scaled, and stand secure.


Towards all that breathe, with seemly graciousness adorned they live;
And thus to virtue's sons the name of 'Anthanar' men give.


It yields distinction, yields prosperity; what gain
Greater than virtue can a living man obtain?


No greater gain than virtue aught can cause;
No greater loss than life oblivious of her laws.


To finish virtue's work with ceaseless effort strive,
What way thou may'st, where'er thou see'st the work may thrive.


Spotless be thou in mind! This only merits virtue's name;
All else, mere pomp of idle sound, no real worth can claim.


'Tis virtue when, his footsteps sliding not through envy, wrath,
Lust, evil speech-these four, man onwards moves in ordered path.


Do deeds of virtue now. Say not, 'To-morrow we'll be wise';
Thus, when thou diest, shalt thou find a help that never dies.


Needs not in words to dwell on virtue's fruits: compare
The man in litter borne with them that toiling bear!


If no day passing idly, good to do each day you toil,
A stone it will be to block the way of future days of moil.


What from virtue floweth, yieldeth dear delight;
All else extern, is void of glory's light.


'Virtue' sums the things that should be done;
'Vice' sums the things that man should shun.


The men of household virtue, firm in way of good, sustain
The other orders three that rule professed maintain.


To anchorites, to indigent, to those who've passed away,
The man for household virtue famed is needful held and stay.


The manes, God, guests kindred, self, in due degree,
These five to cherish well is chiefest charity.


Who shares his meal with other, while all guilt he shuns,
His virtuous line unbroken though the ages runs.


If love and virtue in the household reign,
This is of life the perfect grace and gain.


If man in active household life a virtuous soul retain,
What fruit from other modes of virtue can he gain?


In nature's way who spends his calm domestic days,
'Mid all that strive for virtue's crown hath foremost place.


Others it sets upon their way, itself from virtue ne'er declines;
Than stern ascetics' pains such life domestic brighter shines.


The life domestic rightly bears true virtue's name;
That other too, if blameless found, due praise may claim.


Who shares domestic life, by household virtues graced,
Shall, mid the Gods, in heaven who dwell, be placed.


As doth the house beseem, she shows her wifely dignity;
As doth her husband's wealth befit, she spends: help - meet is she.


If household excellence be wanting in the wife,
Howe'er with splendour lived, all worthless is the life.


There is no lack within the house, where wife in worth excels,
There is no luck within the house, where wife dishonoured dwells.


If woman might of chastity retain,
What choicer treasure doth the world contain?


No God adoring, low she bends before her lord;
Then rising, serves: the rain falls instant at her word!


Who guards herself, for husband's comfort cares, her household's fame,
In perfect wise with sleepless soul preserves, -give her a woman's name.


Of what avail is watch and ward?
Honour's woman's safest guard.


If wife be wholly true to him who gained her as his bride,
Great glory gains she in the world where gods bliss abide.


Who have not spouses that in virtue's praise delight,
They lion-like can never walk in scorner's sight.


The house's 'blessing', men pronounce the house-wife excellent;
The gain of blessed children is its goodly ornament.


Of all that men acquire, we know not any greater gain,
Than that which by the birth of learned children men obtain.


Who children gain, that none reproach, of virtuous worth,
No evils touch them, through the sev'n-fold maze of birth.


'Man's children are his fortune,' say the wise;
From each one's deeds his varied fortunes rise.


Than God's ambrosia sweeter far the food before men laid,
In which the little hands of children of their own have play'd.


To patent sweet the touch of children dear;
Their voice is sweetest music to his ear.


'The pipe is sweet,' 'the lute is sweet,' by them't will be averred,
Who music of their infants' lisping lips have never heard.

Sire greatest boon on son confers, who makes him meet,
In councils of the wise to fill the highest seat.


Their children's wisdom greater than their own confessed,
Through the wide world is sweet to every human breast.


When mother hears him named 'fulfill'd of wisdom's lore,'
Far greater joy she feels, than when her son she bore.


To sire, what best requital can by grateful child be done?
To make men say, 'What merit gained the father such a son?'


And is there bar that can even love restrain?
The tiny tear shall make the lover's secret plain.


The loveless to themselves belong alone;
The loving men are others' to the very bone.


Of precious soul with body's flesh and bone,
The union yields one fruit, the life of love alone.


From love fond yearning springs for union sweet of minds;
And that the bond of rare excelling friendship binds.


Sweetness on earth and rarest bliss above,
These are the fruits of tranquil life of love.


The unwise deem love virtue only can sustain,
It also helps the man who evil would restrain.


As sun's fierce ray dries up the boneless things,
So loveless beings virtue's power to nothing brings.


The loveless soul, the very joys of life may know,
When flowers, in barren soil, on sapless trees, shall blow.


Though every outward part complete, the body's fitly framed;
What good, when soul within, of love devoid, lies halt and maimed?


Bodies of loveless men are bony framework clad with skin;
Then is the body seat of life, when love resides within.


All household cares and course of daily life have this in view.
Guests to receive with courtesy, and kindly acts to do.


Though food of immortality should crown the board,
Feasting alone, the guests without unfed, is thing abhorred.


Each day he tends the coming guest with kindly care;
Painless, unfailing plenty shall his household share.


With smiling face he entertains each virtuous guest,
'Fortune' with gladsome mind shall in his dwelling rest.


Who first regales his guest, and then himself supplies,
O'er all his fields, unsown, shall plenteous harvests rise.


The guest arrived he tends, the coming guest expects to see;
To those in heavenly homes that dwell a welcome guest is he.


To reckon up the fruit of kindly deeds were all in vain;
Their worth is as the worth of guests you entertain.


With pain they guard their stores, yet 'All forlorn are we,' they'll cry,
Who cherish not their guests, nor kindly help supply.


To turn from guests is penury, though worldly goods abound;
'Tis senseless folly, only with the senseless found.


The flower of 'Anicha' withers away, If you do but its fragrance inhale;
If the face of the host cold welcome convey, The guest's heart within him will fail.


Pleasant words are words with all pervading love that burn;
Words from his guileless mouth who can the very truth discern.


A pleasant word with beaming smile's preferred,
Even to gifts with liberal heart conferred.


With brightly beaming smile, and kindly light of loving eye,
And heart sincere, to utter pleasant words is charity.


The men of pleasant speech that gladness breathe around,
Through indigence shall never sorrow's prey be found.


Humility with pleasant speech to man on earth,
Is choice adornment; all besides is nothing worth.


Who seeks out good, words from his lips of sweetness flow;
In him the power of vice declines, and virtues grow.


The words of sterling sense, to rule of right that strict adhere,
To virtuous action prompting, blessings yield in every sphere.


Sweet kindly words, from meanness free, delight of heart,
In world to come and in this world impart.


Who sees the pleasure kindly speech affords,
Why makes he use of harsh, repellant words?


When pleasant words are easy, bitter words to use,
Is, leaving sweet ripe fruit, the sour unripe to choose.


Assistance given by those who ne'er received our aid,
Is debt by gift of heaven and earth but poorly paid.


A timely benefit, -though thing of little worth,
The gift itself, -in excellence transcends the earth.


Kindness shown by those who weigh not what the return may be:
When you ponder right its merit, 'Tis vaster than the sea.


Each benefit to those of actions' fruit who rightly deem,
Though small as millet-seed, as palm-tree vast will seem.


The kindly aid's extent is of its worth no measure true;
Its worth is as the worth of him to whom the act you do.


Kindness of men of stainless soul remember evermore!
Forsake thou never friends who were thy stay in sorrow sore!


Through all seven worlds, in seven-fold birth, Remains in mem'ry of the wise.
Friendship of those who wiped on earth, The tears of sorrow from their eyes.


'Tis never good to let the thought of good things done thee pass away;
Of things not good, 'tis good to rid thy memory that very day.


Effaced straightway is deadliest injury,
By thought of one kind act in days gone by.


Who every good have killed, may yet destruction flee;
Who 'benefit' has killed, that man shall ne'er 'scape free!


If justice, failing not, its quality maintain,
Giving to each his due, -'tis man's one highest gain.


The just man's wealth unwasting shall endure,
And to his race a lasting joy ensure.


Though only good it seem to give, yet gain
By wrong acquired, not e'en one day retain!


Who just or unjust lived shall soon appear:
By each one's offspring shall the truth be clear.


The gain and loss in life are not mere accident;
Just mind inflexible is sages' ornament.


If, right deserting, heart to evil turn,
Let man impending ruin's sign discern!


The man who justly lives, tenacious of the right,
In low estate is never low to wise man's sight.


To stand, like balance-rod that level hangs and rightly weighs,
With calm unbiassed equity of soul, is sages' praise.


Inflexibility in word is righteousness,
If men inflexibility of soul possess.


As thriving trader is the trader known,
Who guards another's interests as his own.


Control of self does man conduct to bliss th' immortals share;
Indulgence leads to deepest night, and leaves him there.


Guard thou as wealth the power of self-control;
Than this no greater gain to living soul!


If versed in wisdom's lore by virtue's law you self restrain.
Your self-repression known will yield you glory's gain.


In his station, all unswerving, if man self subdue,
Greater he than mountain proudly rising to the view.


To all humility is goodly grace; but chief to them
With fortune blessed, -'tis fortune's diadem.


Like tortoise, who the five restrains
In one, through seven world bliss obtains.


Whate'er they fail to guard, o'er lips men guard should keep;
If not, through fault of tongue, they bitter tears shall weep.


Though some small gain of good it seem to bring,
The evil word is parent still of evil thing.


In flesh by fire inflamed, nature may thoroughly heal the sore;
In soul by tongue inflamed, the ulcer healeth never more.


Who learns restraint, and guards his soul from wrath,
Virtue, a timely aid, attends his path.


'Decorum' gives especial excellence; with greater care
'Decorum' should men guard than life, which all men share.


Searching, duly watching, learning, 'decorum' still we find;
Man's only aid; toiling, guard thou this with watchful mind.


'Decorum's' true nobility on earth;
'Indecorum's' issue is ignoble birth.


Though he forget, the Brahman may regain his Vedic lore;
Failing in 'decorum due,' birthright's gone for evermore.


The envious soul in life no rich increase of blessing gains,
So man of 'due decorum' void no dignity obtains.


The strong of soul no jot abate of 'strict decorum's' laws,
Knowing that 'due decorum's' breach foulest disgrace will cause.


'Tis source of dignity when 'true decorum' is preserved;
Who break 'decorum's' rules endure e'en censures undeserved.


'Decorum true' observed a seed of good will be;
'Decorum's breach' will sorrow yield eternally.


It cannot be that they who 'strict decorum's' law fulfil,
E'en in forgetful mood, should utter words of ill.


Who know not with the world in harmony to dwell,
May many things have learned, but nothing well.


Who laws of virtue and possession's rights have known,
Indulge no foolish love of her by right another's own.


No fools, of all that stand from virtue's pale shut out,
Like those who longing lurk their neighbour's gate without.


They're numbered with the dead, e'en while they live, -how otherwise?
With wife of sure confiding friend who evil things devise.


How great soe'er they be, what gain have they of life,
Who, not a whit reflecting, seek a neighbour's wife.


'Mere triflel' saying thus, invades the home, so he ensures.
A gain of guilt that deathless aye endures.


Who home ivades, from him pass nevermore,
Hatred and sin, fear, foul disgrace; these four.


Who sees the wife, another's own, with no desiring eye
In sure domestic bliss he dwelleth ever virtuously.


Manly excellence, that looks not on another's wife,
Is not virtue merely, 'tis full 'propriety' of life.


Who 're good indeed, on earth begirt by ocean's gruesome tide?
The men who touch not her that is another's bride.


Though virtue's bounds he pass, and evil deeds hath wrought;
At least, 'tis good if neighbour's wife he covet not.


As earth bears up the men who delve into her breast,
To bear with scornful men of virtues is the best.


Forgiving trespasses is good always;
Forgetting them hath even higher praise;


The sorest poverty is bidding guest unfed depart;
The mightiest might to bear with men of foolish heart.


Seek'st thou honour never tarnished to retain;
So must thou patience, guarding evermore, maintain.


Who wreak their wrath as worthless are despised;
Who patiently forbear as gold are prized.


Who wreak their wrath have pleasure for a day;
Who bear have praise till earth shall pass away.


Though others work thee ill, thus shalt thou blessing reap;
Grieve for their sin, thyself from vicious action keep!


With overweening pride when men with injuries assail,
By thine own righteous dealing shalt thou mightily prevail.


They who transgressors' evil words endure
With patience, are as stern ascetics pure.


Though 'great' we deem the men that fast and suffer pain,
Who others' bitter words endure, the foremost place obtain.


As 'strict decorum's' laws, that all men bind,
Let each regard unenvying grace of mind.


If man can learn to envy none on earth,
'Tis richest gift, -beyond compare its worth.


Nor wealth nor virtue does that man desire 'tis plain,
Whom others' wealth delights not, feeling envious pain.


The wise through envy break not virtue's laws,
Knowing ill-deeds of foul disgrace the cause.


Envy they have within! Enough to seat their fate!
Though foemen fail, envy can ruin consummate.


Who scans good gifts to others given with envious eye,
His kin, with none to clothe or feed them, surely die.


From envious man good fortune's goddess turns away,
Grudging him good, and points him out misfortune's prey.


Envy, embodied ill, incomparable bane,
Good fortune slays, and soul consigns to fiery pain.


To men of envious heart, when comes increase of joy,
Or loss to blameless men, the 'why' will thoughtful hearts employ.


No envious men to large and full felicity attain;
No men from envy free have failed a sure increase to gain.


With soul unjust to covet others' well-earned store,
Brings ruin to the home, to evil opes the door.


Through lust of gain, no deeds that retribution bring,
Do they, who shrink with shame from every unjust thing.


No deeds of ill, misled by base desire,
Do they, whose souls to other joys aspire.


Men who have conquered sense, with sight from sordid vision freed,
Desire not other's goods, e'en in the hour of sorest need.


What gain, though lore refined of amplest reach he learn,
His acts towards all mankind if covetous desire to folly turn?


Though, grace desiring, he in virtue's way stand strong,
He's lost who wealth desires, and ponders deeds of wrong.


Seek not increase by greed of gain acquired;
That fruit matured yields never good desired.


What saves prosperity from swift decline?
Absence of lust to make another's cherished riches thine!


Good fortune draws anigh in helpful time of need,
To him who, schooled in virtue, guards his soul from greed.


From thoughtless lust of other's goods springs fatal ill,
Greatness of soul that covets not shall triumph still.


Though virtuous words his lips speak not, and all his deeds are ill.
If neighbour he defame not, there's good within him still.


Than he who virtue scorns, and evil deeds performs, more vile,
Is he that slanders friend, then meets him with false smile.


'Tis greater gain of virtuous good for man to die,
Than live to slander absent friend, and falsely praise when nigh.


In presence though unkindly words you speak, say not
In absence words whose ill result exceeds your thought.


The slanderous meanness that an absent friend defames,
'This man in words owns virtue, not in heart,' proclaims.


Who on his neighbours' sins delights to dwell,
The story of his sins, culled out with care, the world will tell.


With friendly art who know not pleasant words to say,
Speak words that sever hearts, and drive choice friends away.


Whose nature bids them faults of closest friends proclaim
What mercy will they show to other men's good name?


'Tis charity, I ween, that makes the earth sustain their load.
Who, neighbours' absence watching, tales or slander tell abroad.


If each his own, as neighbours' faults would scan,
Could any evil hap to living man?


Words without sense, while chafe the wise,
Who babbles, him will all despise.


Words without sense, where many wise men hear, to pour
Than deeds to friends ungracious done offendeth more.


Diffusive speech of useless words proclaims
A man who never righteous wisdom gains.


Unmeaning, worthless words, said to the multitude,
To none delight afford, and sever men from good.


Gone are both fame and boasted excellence,
When men of worth speak of words devoid of sense.


Who makes display of idle words' inanity,
Call him not man, -chaff of humanity!


Let those who list speak things that no delight afford,
'Tis good for men of worth to speak no idle word.


The wise who weigh the worth of every utterance,
Speak none but words of deep significance.


The men of vision pure, from wildering folly free,
Not e'en in thoughtless hour, speak words of vanity.


If speak you will, speak words that fruit afford,
If speak you will, speak never fruitless word.


With sinful act men cease to feel the dread of ill within,
The excellent will dread the wanton pride of cherished sin.


Since evils new from evils ever grow,
Evil than fire works out more dreaded woe.


Even to those that hate make no return of ill;
So shalt thou wisdom's highest law, 'tis said, fulfil.


Though good thy soul forget, plot not thy neighbour's fall,
Thy plans shall 'virtue's Power' by ruin to thyself forestall.


Make not thy poverty a plea for ill;
Thy evil deeds will make thee poorer still.


What ranks as evil spare to do, if thou would'st shun
Affliction sore through ill to thee by others done.


From every enmity incurred there is to 'scape, a way;
The wrath of evil deeds will dog men's steps, and slay.


Man's shadow dogs his steps where'er he wends;
Destruction thus on sinful deeds attends.


Beware, if to thyself thyself is dear,
Lest thou to aught that ranks as ill draw near!


The man, to devious way of sin that never turned aside,
From ruin rests secure, whatever ills betide.


Duty demands no recompense; to clouds of heaven,
By men on earth, what answering gift is given?


The worthy say, when wealth rewards their toil-spent hours,
For uses of beneficence alone 'tis ours.


To 'due beneficence' no equal good we know,
Amid the happy gods, or in this world below.


Who knows what's human life's befitting grace,
He lives; the rest 'mongst dead men have their place.


The wealth of men who love the 'fitting way,' the truly wise,
Is as when water fills the lake that village needs supplies.


A tree that fruits in th' hamlet's central mart,
Is wealth that falls to men of liberal heart.


Unfailing tree that healing balm distils from every part,
Is ample wealth that falls to him of large and noble heart.


E'en when resources fall, they weary not of 'kindness due,'-
They to whom Duty's self appears in vision true.


The kindly-hearted man is poor in this alone,
When power of doing deeds of goodness he finds none.


Though by 'beneficence,' the loss of all should come,
'Twere meet man sold himself, and bought it with the sum.



Call that a gift to needy men thou dost dispense,
All else is void of good, seeking for recompense.


Though men declare it heavenward path, yet to receive is ill;
Though upper heaven were not, to give is virtue still.


'I've nought' is ne'er the high-born man's reply;
He gives to those who raise themselves that cry.


The suppliants' cry for aid yields scant delight,
Until you see his face with grateful gladness bright.


'Mid devotees they're great who hunger's pangs sustain,
Who hunger's pangs relieve a higher merit gain.


Let man relieve the wasting hunger men endure;
For treasure gained thus finds he treasure-house secure.


Whose soul delights with hungry men to share his meal,
The hand of hunger's sickness sore shall never feel.


Delight of glad'ning human hearts with gifts do they not know.
Men of unpitying eye, who hoard their wealth and lose it so?


They keep their garners full, for self alone the board they spread;-
'Tis greater pain, be sure, than begging daily bread!


'Tis bitter pain to die, 'Tis worse to live.
For him who nothing finds to give!


See that thy life the praise of generous gifts obtain;
Save this for living man exists no real gain.


The speech of all that speak agrees to crown
The men that give to those that ask, with fair renown.


Save praise alone that soars on high,
Nought lives on earth that shall not die.


If men do virtuous deeds by world-wide ample glory crowned,
The heavens will cease to laud the sage for other gifts renowned.


Loss that is gain, and death of life's true bliss fulfilled,
Are fruits which only wisdom rare can yield.


If man you walk the stage, appear adorned with glory's grace;
Save glorious you can shine, 'twere better hide your face.


If you your days will spend devoid of goodly fame,
When men despise, why blame them? You've yourself to blame.


Fame is virtue's child, they say; if, then,
You childless live, you live the scorn of men.


The blameless fruits of fields' increase will dwindle down,
If earth the burthen bear of men without renown.


Who live without reproach, them living men we deem;
Who live without renown, live not, though living men they seem.



Wealth 'mid wealth is wealth 'kindliness';
Wealth of goods the vilest too possess.


The law of 'grace' fulfil, by methods good due trial made,
Though many systems you explore, this is your only aid.


They in whose breast a 'gracious kindliness' resides,
See not the gruesome world, where darkness drear abides.


Who for undying souls of men provides with gracious zeal,
In his own soul the dreaded guilt of sin shall never feel.


The teeming earth's vast realm, round which the wild winds blow,
Is witness, men of 'grace' no woeful want shall know.


Gain of true wealth oblivious they eschew,
Who 'grace' forsake, and graceless actions do.


As to impoverished men this present world is not;
The 'graceless' in you world have neither part nor lot.


Who lose the flower of wealth, when seasons change, again may bloom;
Who lose 'benevolence', lose all; nothing can change their doom.


When souls unwise true wisdom's mystic vision see,
The 'graceless' man may work true works of charity.


When weaker men you front with threat'ning brow,
Think how you felt in presence of some stronger foe.


How can the wont of 'kindly grace' to him be known,
Who other creatures' flesh consumes to feed his own?


No use of wealth have they who guard not their estate;
No use of grace have they with flesh who hunger sate.


Like heart of them that murderous weapons bear, his mind,
Who eats of savoury meat, no joy in good can find.


'What's grace, or lack of grace'? 'To kill' is this, that 'not to kill';
To eat dead flesh can never worthy end fulfil.


If flesh you eat not, life's abodes unharmed remain;
Who eats, hell swallows him, and renders not again.


'We eat the slain,' you say, by us no living creatures die;
Who'd kill and sell, I pray, if none came there the flesh to buy?


With other beings' ulcerous wounds their hunger they appease;
If this they felt, desire to eat must surely cease.


Whose souls the vision pure and passionless perceive,
Eat not the bodies men of life bereave.


Than thousand rich oblations, with libations rare,
Better the flesh of slaughtered beings not to share.


Who slays nought,- flesh rejects- his feet before
All living things with clasped hands adore.


To bear due penitential pains, while no offence
He causes others, is the type of 'penitence'.


To 'penitents' sincere avails their 'penitence';
Where that is not, 'tis but a vain pretence.


Have other men forgotten 'penitence' who strive
To earn for penitents the things by which they live?


Destruction to his foes, to friends increase of joy.
The 'penitent' can cause, if this his thoughts employ.


That what they wish may, as they wish, be won,
By men on earth are works of painful 'penance' done.


Who works of 'penance' do, their end attain,
Others in passion's net enshared, toil but in vain.


The hotter glows the fining fire, the gold the brighter shines;
The pain of penitence, like fire, the soul of man refines.


Who gains himself in utter self-control,
Him worships every other living soul.


E'en over death the victory he may gain,
If power by penance won his soul obtain.


The many all things lack! The cause is plain,
The 'penitents' are few. The many shun such pain.


Who with deceitful mind in false way walks of covert sin,
The five-fold elements his frame compose, decide within.


What gain, though virtue's semblance high as heaven his fame exalt,
If heart dies down through sense of self-detected fault?


As if a steer should graze wrapped round with tiger's skin,
Is show of virtuous might when weakness lurks within.


'Tis as a fowler, silly birds to snare, in thicket lurks.
When, clad in stern ascetic garb, one secret evil works.


'Our souls are free,' who say, yet practise evil secretly,
'What folly have we wrought!' by many shames o'er-whelmed, shall cry.


In mind renouncing nought, in speech renouncing every tie,
Who guileful live,- no men are found than these of 'harder eye'.


Outward, they shine as 'kunri' berry's scarlet bright;
Inward, like tip of 'kunri' bead, as black as night.


Many wash in hollowed waters, living lives of hidden shame;
Foul in heart, yet high upraised of men in virtuous fame.


Cruel is the arrow straight, the crooked lute is sweet,
Judge by their deeds the many forms of men you meet.


What's the worth of shaven head or tresses long,
If you shun what all the world condemns as wrong?


Who seeks heaven's joys, from impious levity secure,
Let him from every fraud preserve his spirit pure.


'Tis sin if in the mind man but thought conceive;
'By fraud I will my neighbour of his wealth bereave.'


The gain that comes by fraud, although it seems to grow
With limitless increase, to ruin swift shall go.


The lust inveterate of fraudful gain,
Yields as its fruit undying pain.


'Grace' is not in their thoughts, nor know they kind affection's power,
Who neighbour's goods desire, and watch for his unguarded hour.


They cannot walk restrained in wisdom's measured bound,
In whom inveterate lust of fraudful gain is found.


Practice of fraud's dark cunning arts they shun,
Who long for power by 'measured wisdom' won.


As virtue dwells in heart that 'measured wisdom' gains;
Deceit in hearts of fraudful men established reigns.


Who have no lore save that which fraudful arts supply,
Acts of unmeasured vice committing straightway die.


The fraudful forfeit life and being here below;
Who fraud eschew the bliss of heavenly beings know.


You ask, in lips of men what 'truth' may be;
'Tis speech from every taint of evil free.


Falsehood may take the place of truthful word,
If blessing, free from fault, it can afford.


Speak not a word which false thy own heart knows
Self-kindled fire within the false one's spirit glows.


True to his inmost soul who lives,- enshrined
He lives in souls of all mankind.


Greater is he who speaks the truth with full consenting mind.
Than men whose lives have penitence and charity combined.


No praise like that of words from falsehood free;
This every virtue yields spontaneously.


If all your life be utter truth, the truth alone,
'Tis well, though other virtuous acts be left undone.


Outward purity the water will bestow;
Inward purity from truth alone will flow.


Every lamp is not a lamp in wise men's sight;
That's the lamp with truth's pure radiance bright.


Of all good things we've scanned with studious care,
There's nought that can with truthfulness compare.


Where thou hast power thy angry will to work, thy wrath restrain;
Where power is none, what matter if thou check or give it rein?


Where power is none to wreak thy wrath, wrath importent is ill;
Where thou hast power thy will to work, 'tis greater, evil still.


If any rouse thy wrath, the trespass straight forget;
For wrath an endless train of evils will beget.


Wrath robs the face of smiles, the heart of joy,
What other foe to man works such annoy?


If thou would'st guard thyself, guard against wrath alway;
'Gainst wrath who guards not, him his wrath shall slay.


Wrath, the fire that slayeth whose draweth near,
Will burn the helpful 'raft' of kindred dear.


The hand that smites the earth unfailing feels the sting;
So perish they who nurse their wrath as noble thing.


Though men should work thee woe, like touch of tongues of fire.
'Tis well if thou canst save thy soul from burning ire.


If man his soul preserve from wrathful fires,
He gains with that whate'er his soul desires.


Men of surpassing wrath are like the men who've passed away;
Who wrath renounce, equals of all-renouncing sages they.


Though ill to neighbour wrought should glorious pride of wealth secure,
No ill to do is fixed decree of men in spirit pure.


Though malice work its worst, planning no ill return, to endure,
And work no ill, is fixed decree of men in spirit pure.


Though unprovoked thy soul malicious foes should sting,
Retaliation wrought inevitable woes will bring.


To punish wrong, with kindly benefits the doers ply;
Thus shame their souls; but pass the ill unheeded by.


From wisdom's vaunted lore what doth the learner gain,
If as his own he guard not others' souls from pain?


What his own soul has felt as bitter pain,
From making others feel should man abstain.


To work no wilful woe, in any wise, through all the days,
To any living soul, is virtue's highest praise.


Whose soul has felt the bitter smart of wrong, how can
He wrongs inflict on ever-living soul of man?


If, ere the noontide, you to others evil do,
Before the eventide will evil visit you.


O'er every evil-doer evil broodeth still;
He evil shuns who freedom seeks from ill.



What is the work of virtue? 'Not to kill';
For 'killing' leads to every work of ill.


Let those that need partake your meal; guard every-thing that lives;
This the chief and sum of lore that hoarded wisdom gives.


Alone, first of goods things, is 'not to slay';
The second is, no untrue word to say.


You ask, What is the good and perfect way?
'Tis path of him who studies nought to slay.


Of those who 'being' dread, and all renounce, the chief are they,
Who dreading crime of slaughter, study nought to slay.


Ev'n death that life devours, their happy days shall spare,
Who law, 'Thou shall not kill', uphold with reverent care.


Though thine own life for that spared life the price must pay,
Take not from aught that lives gift of sweet life away.


Though great the gain of good should seem, the wise
Will any gain by staughter won despise.


Whose trade is 'killing', always vile they show,
To minds of them who what is vileness know.


Who lead a loathed life in bodies sorely pained,
Are men, the wise declare, by guilt of slaughter stained.


Lowest and meanest lore, that bids men trust secure,
In things that pass away, as things that shall endure!


As crowds round dancers fill the hall, is wealth's increase;
Its loss, as throngs dispersing, when the dances cease.


Unenduring is all wealth; if you wealth enjoy,
Enduring works in working wealth straightway employ.


As 'day' it vaunts itself; well understood, 'tis knife',
That daily cuts away a portion from thy life.


Before the tongue lie powerless, 'mid the gasp of gurgling breath,
Arouse thyself, and do good deeds beyond the power of death.


Existing yesterday, today to nothing hurled!-
Such greatness owns this transitory world.


Who know not if their happy lives shall last the day,
In fancies infinite beguile the hours away!


Birds fly away, and leave the nest deserted bare;
Such is the short-lived friendship soul and body share.


Death is sinking into slumbers deep;
Birth again is waking out of sleep.


The soul in fragile shed as lodger courts repose:-
Is it because no home's conclusive rest it knows?


From whatever, aye, whatever, man gets free,
From what, aye, from that, no more of pain hath he!


'Renunciation' made- ev'n here true pleasures men acquire;
'Renounce' while time is yet, if to those pleasures you aspire.


'Perceptions of the five' must all expire;-
Relinquished in its order each desire


'Privation absolute' is penance true;
'Possession' brings bewilderment anew.


To those who sev'rance seek from being's varied strife,
Flesh is burthen sore; what then other bonds of life?


Who kills conceit that utters 'I' and 'mine',
Shall enter realms above the powers divine.


Who cling to things that cling and eager clasp,
Griefs cling to them with unrelaxing grasp.


Who thoroughly 'renounce' on highest height are set;
The rest bewildered, lie entangled in the net.


When that which clings falls off, severed is being's tie;
All else will then be seen as instability.


Cling thou to that which He, to Whom nought clings, hath bid thee cling,
Cling to that bond, to get thee free from every clinging thing.


Of things devoid of truth as real things men deem;-
Cause of degraded birth the fond delusive dream!


Darkness departs, and rapture springs to men who see,
The mystic vision pure, from all delusion free.


When doubts disperse, and mists of error roll
Away, nearer is heav'n than earth to sage's soul.


Five-fold perception gained, what benefits accrue
To them whose spirits lack perception of the true?


Whatever thing, of whatsoever kind it be,
'Tis wisdom's part in each the very thing to see.


Who learn, and here the knowledge of the true obtain,
Shall find the path that hither cometh not again.


The mind that knows with certitude what is, and ponders well,
Its thoughts on birth again to other life need not to dwell.


When folly, cause of births, departs; and soul can view
The truth of things, man's dignity- 'tis wisdom true.


When lust and wrath and error's triple tyranny is o'er,
Their very names for aye extinct, then pain shall be no more.


The wise declare, through all the days, to every living thing.
That ceaseless round of birth from seed of strong desire doth spring.


If desire you feel, freedom from changing birth require!
'I' will come, if you desire to 'scape, set free from all desire.


No glorious wealth is here like freedom from desire;
To bliss like this not even there can soul aspire.


Desire's decease as purity men know;
That, too, from yearning search for truth will grow.


Men freed from bonds of strong desire are free;
None other share such perfect liberty.


Desire each soul beguiles;
True virtue dreads its wiles.


Who thoroughly rids his life of passion-prompted deed,
Deeds of unfailing worth shall do, which, as he plans, succeed.


Affliction is not known where no desires abide;
Where these are, endless rises sorrow's tide.


When dies away desire, that woe of woes
Ev'n here the soul unceasing rapture knows.


Drive from thy soul desire insatiate;
Straight'way is gained the moveless blissful state.


Wealth-giving fate power of unflinching effort brings;
From fate that takes away idle remissness springs.


The fate that loss ordains makes wise men's wisdom foolishness;
The fate that gain bestows with ampler powers will wisdom bless.


In subtle learning manifold though versed man be,
'The wisdom, truly his, will gain supremacy.


Two fold the fashion of the world: some live in fortune's light;
While other some have souls in wisdom's radiance bright.


All things that good appear will oft have ill success;
All evil things prove good for gain of happiness.


Things not your own will yield no good, howe'er you guard with pain;
Your own, howe'er you scatter them abroad, will yours remain.


Save as the 'sharer' shares to each in due degree,
To those who millions store enjoyment scarce can be.


The destitute with ascetics merit share,
If fate to visit with predestined ills would spare.


When good things come, men view them all as gain;
When evils come, why then should they complain?


What powers so great as those of Destiny? Man's skill
Some other thing contrives; but fate's beforehand still.


Courage, a liberal hand, wisdom, and energy: these four
Are qualities a king adorn for evermore.


A sleepless promptitude, knowledge, decision strong:
These three for aye to rulers of the land belong.


Kingship, in virtue failing not, all vice restrains,
In courage failing not, it honour's grace maintains.


A king is he who treasure gains, stores up, defends,
And duly for his kingdom's weal expends.


Where king is easy of access, where no harsh word repels,
That land's high praises every subject swells.


With pleasant speech, who gives and guards with powerful liberal hand,
He sees the world obedient all to his command.


Who guards the realm and justice strict maintains,
That king as god o'er subject people reigns.


The king of worth, who can words bitter to his ear endure,
Beneath the shadow of his power the world abides secure.


Gifts, grace, right sceptre, care of people's weal;
These four a light of dreaded kings reveal.


So learn that you may full and faultless learning gain,
Then in obedience meet to lessons learnt remain.


The twain that lore of numbers and of letters give
Are eyes, the wise declare, to all on earth that live.


Men who learning gain have eyes, men say;
Blockheads' faces pairs of sores display.


You meet with joy, with pleasant thought you part;
Such is the learned scholar's wonderous art!


With soul submiss they stand, as paupers front a rich man's face;
Yet learned men are first; th'unlearned stand in lowest place.


In sandy soil, when deep you delve, you reach the springs below;
The more you learn, the freer streams of wisdom flow.


The learned make each land their own, in every city find a home;
Who, till they die; learn nought, along what weary ways they roam!


The man who store of learning gains,
In one, through seven worlds, bliss attains.


Their joy is joy of all the world, they see; thus more
The learners learn to love their cherished lore.


Learning is excellence of wealth that none destroy;
To man nought else affords reality of joy.


Like those at draughts would play without the chequered square,
Men void of ample lore would counsels of the learned share.


Like those who doat on hoyden's undeveloped charms are they,
Of learning void, who eagerly their power of words display.


The blockheads, too, may men of worth appear,
If they can keep from speaking where the learned hear!


From blockheads' lips, when words of wisdom glibly flow,
The wise receive them not, though good they seem to show.


As worthless shows the worth of man unlearned,
When council meets, by words he speaks discerned.


'They are': so much is true of men untaught;
But, like a barren field, they yield us nought!


Who lack the power of subtle, large, and penetrating sense,
Like puppet, decked with ornaments of clay, their beauty's vain pretence.


To men unlearned, from fortune's favour greater-evil springs
Than poverty to men of goodly wisdom brings.


Lower are men unlearned, though noble be their race,
Than low-born men adorned with learning's grace.


Learning's irradiating grace who gain,
Others excel, as men the bestial train.


Wealth of wealth is wealth acquired be ear attent;
Wealth mid all wealth supremely excellent.


When 'tis no longer time the listening ear to feed
With trifling dole of food supply the body's need.


Who feed their ear with learned teachings rare,
Are like the happy gods oblations rich who share.


Though learning none hath he, yet let him hear alway:
In weakness this shall prove a staff and stay.


Like staff in hand of him in slippery ground who strays
Are words from mouth of those who walk in righteous ways.


Let each man good things learn, for e'en as he
Shall learn, he gains increase of perfect dignity.


Not e'en through inadvertence speak they foolish word,
With clear discerning mind who've learning's ample lessons heard.


Where teaching hath not oped the learner's ear,
The man may listen, but he scarce can hear.


'Tis hard for mouth to utter gentle, modest word,
When ears discourse of lore refined have never heard.


His mouth can taste, but ear no taste of joy can give!
What matter if he die, or prosperous live?


True wisdom wards off woes, A circling fortress high;
Its inner strength man's eager foes Unshaken will defy.


Wisdom restrains, nor suffers mind to wander where it would;
From every evil calls it back, and guides in way of good.


Though things diverse from divers sages' lips we learn,
'Tis wisdom's part in each the true thing to discern.


Wisdom hath use of lucid speech, words that acceptance win,
And subtle sense of other men's discourse takes in.


Wisdom embraces frank the world, to no caprice exposed;
Unlike the lotus flower, now opened wide, now petals strictly closed.


As dwells the world, so with the world to dwell
In harmony- this is to wisely live and well.


The wise discern, the foolish fail to see,
And minds prepare for things about to be.


Folly meets fearful ills with fearless heart;
To fear where cause of fear exists is wisdom's part.


The wise with watchful soul who coming ills foresee;
From coming evil's dreaded shock are free.


The wise is rich, with ev'ry blessing blest;
The fool is poor, of everything possessed.


Who arrogance, and wrath, and littleness of low desire restrain,
To sure increase of lofty dignity attain.


A niggard hand, o'erweening self-regard, and mirth
Unseemly, bring disgrace to men of kingly brith.


Though small as millet-seed the fault men deem;
As palm tree vast to those who fear disgrace 'twill seem.


Freedom from faults is wealth; watch heedfully
'Gainst these, for fault is fatal enmity.


His joy who guards not 'gainst the coming evil day,
Like straw before the fire shall swift consume away.


Faultless the king who first his own faults cures, and then
Permits himself to scan faults of other men.


Who leaves undone what should be done, with niggard mind,
His wealth shall perish, leaving not a wrack behind.


The greed of soul that avarice men call,
When faults are summed, is worst of all.


Never indulge in self-complaisant mood,
Nor deed desire that yields no gain of good.


If, to your foes unknown, you cherish what you love,
Counsels of men who wish you harm will harmless prove.



As friends the men who virtue know, and riper wisdom share,
Their worth weighed well, the king should choose with care.


Cherish the all-accomplished men as friends,
Whose skill the present ill removes, from coming ill defends.


To cherish men of mighty soul, and make them all their own,
Of kingly treasures rare, as rarest gift is known.


To live with men of greatness that their own excels,
As cherished friends, is greatest power that with a monarch dwells.


The king, since counsellors are monarch's eyes,
Should counsellors select with counsel wise.


The king, who knows to live with worthy men allied,
Has nought to fear from any foeman's pride.


What power can work his fall, who faithful ministers
Employs, that thunder out reproaches when he errs.


The king with none to censure him, bereft of safeguards all,
Though none his ruin work, shall surely ruined fall.


Who owns no principal, can have no gain of usury;
Who lacks support of friends, knows no stability.


Than hate of many foes incurred, works greater woe
Ten-fold, of worthy men the friendship to forego.


The great of soul will mean association fear;
The mean of soul regard mean men as kinsmen dear.


The waters' virtues change with soil through which they flow;
As man's companionship so will his wisdom show.


Perceptions manifold in men are of the mind alone;
The value of the man by his companionship is known.


Man's wisdom seems the offspring of his mind;
'Tis outcome of companionship we find.


Both purity of mind, and purity of action clear,
Leaning no staff of pure companionship, to man draw near.


From true pure-minded men a virtuous race proceeds;
To men of pure companionship belong no evil deeds.


Goodness of mind to lives of men increaseth gain;
And good companionship doth all of praise obtain.


To perfect men, though minds right good belong,
Yet good companionship is confirmation strong.


Although to mental goodness joys of other life belong,
Yet good companionship is confirmation strong.


Than good companionship no surer help we know;
Than bad companionship nought causes direr woe.


Expenditure, return, and profit of the deed
In time to come; weigh these- than to the act proceed.


With chosen friends deliberate; next use the private thought;
Then act. By those who thus proceed all works with ease are wrought.


To risk one's all and lose, aiming at added gain,
Is rash affair, from which the wise abstain.


A work of which the issue is not clear,
Begin not they reproachful scorn who fear.


With plans not well matured to rise against your foe,
Is way to plant him out where he is sure to grow!


'Tis ruin if man do an unbefitting thing;
Fit things to leave undone will equal ruin bring.


Think, and then dare the deed! Who cry,
'Deed dared, we'll think,' disgraced shall be.


On no right system if man toil and strive,
Though many men assist, no work can thrive.


Though well the work be done, yet one mistake is made,
To habitudes of various men when no regard is paid.


Plan and perform no work that others may despise;
What misbeseems a king the world will not approve as wise.


The force the strife demands, the force he owns, the force of foes,
The force of friends; these should he weigh ere to the war he goes.


Who know what can be wrought, with knowledge of the means, on this,
Their mind firm set, go forth, nought goes with them amiss.


Ill-deeming of their proper powers, have many monarchs striven,
And midmost of unequal conflict fallen asunder riven.


Who not agrees with those around, no moderation knows,
In self-applause indulging, swift to ruin goes.


With peacock feathers light, you load the wain;
Yet, heaped too high, the axle snaps in twain.


Who daring climbs, and would himself upraise
Beyond the branch's tip, with life the forfeit pays.


With knowledge of the measure due, as virtue bids you give!
That is the way to guard your wealth, and seemly live.


Incomings may be scant; but yet, no failure there,
If in expenditure you rightly learn to spare.


Who prosperous lives and of enjoyment knows no bound,
His seeming wealth, departing, nowhere shall be found.


Beneficence that measures not its bound of means,
Will swiftly bring to nought the wealth on which it leans.


A crow will conquer owl in broad daylight;
The king that foes would crush, needs fitting time to fight.


The bond binds fortune fast is ordered effort made,
Strictly observant still of favouring season's aid.


Can any work be hard in very fact,
If men use fitting means in timely act?


The pendant world's dominion may be won,
In fitting time and place by action done.


Who think the pendant world itself to subjugate,
With mind unruffled for the fitting time must wait.


The men of mighty power their hidden energies repress,
As fighting ram recoils to rush on foe with heavier stress.


The glorious once of wrath enkindled make no outward show,
At once; they bide their time, while hidden fires within them glow.


If foes' detested form they see, with patience let them bear;
When fateful hour at last they spy,- the head lies there.


When hardest gain of opportunity at last is won,
With promptitude let hardest deed be done.


As heron stands with folded wing, so wait in waiting hour;
As heron snaps its prey, when fortune smiles, put forth your power.



Begin no work of war, depise no foe,
Till place where you can wholly circumvent you know.


Though skill in war combine with courage tried on battle-field,
The added gain of fort doth great advantage yield.


E'en weak ones mightily prevail, if place of strong defence,
They find, protect themselves, and work their foes offence.


The foes who thought to triumph, find their thoughts were vain,
If hosts advance, seize vantage ground, and thence the fight maintain.


The crocodile prevails in its own flow of water wide,
If this it leaves, 'tis slain by anything beside.


The lofty car, with mighty wheel, sails not o'er watery main,
The boat that skims the sea, runs not on earth's hard plain.


Save their own fearless might they need no other aid,
If in right place they fight, all due provision made.


If lord of army vast the safe retreat assail
Of him whose host is small, his mightiest efforts fail.


Though fort be none, and store of wealth they lack,
'Tis hard a people's homesteads to attack!


The jackal slays, in miry paths of foot-betraying fen,
The elephant of fearless eye and tusks transfixing armed men.


How treats he virtue, wealth and pleasure? How, when life's at stake,
Comports himself? This four-fold test of man will full assurance make.


Of noble race, of faultless worth, of generous pride
That shrinks from shame or stain; in him may king confide.


Though deeply learned, unflecked by fault, 'tis rare to see,
When closely scanned, a man from all unwisdom free.


Weigh well the good of each, his failings closely scan,
As these or those prevail, so estimate the man.


Of greatness and of meanness too,
The deeds of each are touchstone true.


Beware of trusting men who have no kith of kin;
No bonds restrain such men, no shame deters from sin.


By fond affection led who trusts in men of unwise soul,
Yields all his being up to folly's blind control.


Who trusts an untried stranger, brings disgrace,
Remediless, on all his race.


Trust no man whom you have not fully tried,
When tested, in his prudence proved confide.


Trust where you have not tried, doubt of a friend to feel,
Once trusted, wounds inflict that nought can heal.


Who good and evil scanning, ever makes the good his joy;
Such man of virtuous mood should king employ.


Who swells the revenues, spreads plenty o'er the land,
Seeks out what hinders progress, his the workman's hand.


A loyal love with wisdom, clearness, mind from avarice free;
Who hath these four good gifts should ever trusted be.


Even when tests of every kind are multiplied,
Full many a man proves otherwise, by action tried!


Let king first ask, 'Who shall the deed perform?' and 'What the deed?'
Of hour befitting both assured, let every work proceed.


'This man, this work shall thus work out,' let thoughtful king command;
Then leave the matter wholly in his servant's hand.


As each man's special aptitude is known,
Bid each man make that special work his own.


Fortune deserts the king who ill can bear,
Informal friendly ways of men his tolls who share.


Let king search out his servants' deeds each day;
When these do right, the world goes rightly on its way.


When wealth is fled, old kindness still to show,
Is kindly grace that only kinsmen know.


The gift of kin's unfailing love bestows
Much gain of good, like flower that fadeless blows.


His joy of life who mingles not with kinsmen gathered round,
Is lake where streams pour in, with no encircling bound.


The profit gained by wealth's increase,
Is living compassed round by relatives in peace.


Who knows the use of pleasant words, and liberal gifts can give,
Connections, heaps of them, surrounding him shall live.


Than one who gifts bestows and wrath restrains,
Through the wide world none larger following gains.


The crows conceal not, call their friends to come, then eat;
Increase of good such worthy ones shall meet.


Where king regards not all alike, but each in his degree,
'Neath such discerning rule many dwell happily.


Who once were his, and then forsook him, as before
Will come around, when cause of disagreement is no more.


Who causeless went away, then to return, for any cause, ask leave;
The king should sift their motives well, consider, and receive!


'Tis greater ill, it rapture of o'erweening gladness to the soul
Bring self-forgetfulness than if transcendent wrath control.


Perpetual, poverty is death to wisdom of the wise;
When man forgets himself his glory dies!


'To self-oblivious men no praise'; this rule
Decisive wisdom sums of every school.


'To cowards is no fort's defence'; e'en so
The self-oblivious men no blessing know.


To him who nought foresees, recks not of anything,
The after woe shall sure repentance bring.


Towards all unswerving, ever watchfulness of soul retain,
Where this is found there is no greater gain.


Though things are arduous deemed, there's nought may not be won,
When work with mind's unslumbering energy and thought is done.


Let things that merit praise thy watchful soul employ;
Who these despise attain through sevenfold births no joy.


Think on the men whom scornful mind hath brought to nought,
When exultation overwhelms thy wildered thought.


'Tis easy what thou hast in mind to gain,
If what thou hast in mind thy mind retain.


Search out, to no one favour show; with heart that justice loves
Consult, then act; this is the rule that right approves.


All earth looks up to heav'n whence raindrops fall;
All subjects look to king that ruleth all.


Learning and virtue of the sages spring,
From all-controlling sceptre of the king.


Whose heart embraces subjects all, lord over mighty land
Who rules, the world his feet embracing stands.


Where king, who righteous laws regards, the sceptre wields,
There fall the showers, there rich abundance crowns the fields.


Not lance gives kings the victory,
But sceptre swayed with equity.


The king all the whole realm of earth protects;
And justice guards the king who right respects.


Hard of access, nought searching out, with partial hand
The king who rules, shall sink and perish from the land.


Abroad to guard, at home to punish, brings
No just reproach; 'tis work assigned to kings.


By punishment of death the cruel to restrain,
Is as when farmer frees from weeds the tender grain.


Than one who plies the murderer's trade, more cruel is the king
Who all injustice works, his subjects harassing.


As 'Give' the robber cries with lance uplift,
So kings with sceptred hand implore a gift.


Who makes no daily search for wrongs, nor justly rules, that king
Doth day by day his realm to ruin bring.


Whose rod from right deflects, who counsel doth refuse,
At once his wealth and people utterly shall lose.


His people's tears of sorrow past endurance, are not they
Sharp instruments to wear the monarch's wealth away?


To rulers' rule stability is sceptre right;
When this is not, quenched is the rulers' light.


As lack of rain to thirsty lands beneath,
Is lack of grace in kings to all that breathe.


To poverty it adds a sharper sting,
To live beneath the sway of unjust king.


Where king from right deflecting, makes unrighteous gain,
The seasons change, the clouds pour down no rain.


Where guardian guardeth not, udder of kine grows dry,
And Brahmans' sacred lore will all forgotten lie.


Who punishes, investigation made in due degree,
So as to stay advance of crime, a king is he.


For length of days with still increasing joys on Heav'n who call,
Should raise the rod with brow severe, but let it gently fall.


Where subjects dread of cruel wrongs endure,
Ruin to unjust king is swift and sure.


'Ah! cruel is our king', where subjects sadly say,
His age shall dwindle, swift his joy of life decay.


Whom subjects scarce may see, of harsh forbidding countenance;
His ample wealth shall waste, blasted by demon's glance.


The tyrant, harsh in speach and hard of eye,
His ample joy, swift fading, soon shall die.


Harsh words and punishments severe beyond the right,
Are file that wears away the monarch's conquering might.


Who leaves the work to those around, and thinks of it no more;
If he in wrathful mood reprove, his prosperous days are o'er!


Who builds no fort whence he may foe defy,
In time of war shall fear and swiftly die.


Tyrants with fools their counsels share:
Earth can no heavier burthen bear!


Since true benignity, that grace exceeding great, resides
In kingly souls, world in happy state abides.


The world goes on its wonted way, since grace benign is there;
All other men are burthen for the earth to bear.


Where not accordant with the song, what use of sounding chords?
What gain of eye that no benignant light affords?


The seeming eye of face gives no expressive light,
When not with duly meted kindness bright.


Benignity is eyes' adorning grace;
Without it eyes are wounds disfiguring face.


Whose eyes 'neath brow infixed diffuse no ray
Of grace; like tree in earth infixed are they.


Eyeless are they whose eyes with no benignant lustre shine;
Who've eyes can never lack the light of grace benign.


Who can benignant smile, yet leave no work undone;
By them as very own may all the earth be won.


To smile on those that vex, with kindly face,
Enduring long, is most excelling grace.


They drink with smiling grace, though poison interfused they see,
Who seek the praise of all-esteemed courtesy.


These two: the code renowned and spies,
In these let king confide as eyes.


Each day, of every subject every deed,
'Tis duty of the king to learn with speed.


By spies who spies, not weighing things they bring,
Nothing can victory give to that unwary king.


His officers, his friends, his enemies,
All these who watch are trusty spies.


Of unsuspected mien and all-unfearing eyes,
Who let no secret out, are trusty spies.


As monk or devotee, through every hindrance making way,
A spy, whate'er men do, must watchful mind display.


A spy must search each hidden matter out,
And full report must render, free from doubt.


Spying by spies, the things they tell
To test by other spies is well.


One spy must not another see: contrive it so;
And things by three confirmed as truth you know.


Reward not trusty spy in others' sight,
Or all the mystery will come to light.



'Tis energy gives men o'er that they own a true control;
They nothing own who own not energy of soul.


The wealth of mind man owns a real worth imparts,
Material wealth man owns endures not, utterly departs.


'Lost is our wealth,' they utter not this cry distressed,
The men of firm concentred energy of soul possessed.


The man of energy of soul inflexible,
Good fortune seeks him out and comes a friend to dwell.


With rising flood the rising lotus flower its stem unwinds;
The dignity of men is measured by their minds.


Whate'er you ponder, let your aim be loftly still,
Fate cannot hinder always, thwart you as it will.


The men of lofty mind quail not in ruin's fateful hour,
The elephant retains his dignity mind arrows' deadly shower.


The soulless man can never gain
Th' ennobling sense of power with men.


Huge bulk of elephant with pointed tusk all armed,
When tiger threatens shrinks away alarmed!


Firmness of soul in man is real excellance;
Others are trees, their human form a mere pretence.


Of household dignity the lustre beaming bright,
Flickers and dies when sluggish foulness dims its light.


Let indolence, the death of effort, die,
If you'd uphold your household's dignity.


Who fosters indolence within his breast, the silly elf!
The house from which he springs shall perish ere himself.


His family decays, and faults unheeded thrive,
Who, sunk in sloth, for noble objects doth not strive.


Delay, oblivion, sloth, and sleep: these four
Are pleasure-boat to bear the doomed to ruin's shore.


Though lords of earth unearned possessions gain,
The slothful ones no yield of good obtain.


Who hug their sloth, nor noble works attempt,
Shall bear reproofs and words of just contempt.


If sloth a dwelling find mid noble family,
Bondsmen to them that hate them shall they be.


Who changes slothful habits saves
Himself from all that household rule depraves.


The king whose life from sluggishness is rid,
Shall rule o'er all by foot of mighty god bestrid.


Say not, 'Tis hard', in weak, desponding hour,
For strenuous effort gives prevailing power.


In action be thou, 'ware of act's defeat;
The world leaves those who work leave incomplete!


In strenuous effort doth reside
The power of helping others: noble pride!


Beneficent intent in men by whom no strenuous work is wrought,
Like battle-axe in sexless being's hand availeth nought.


Whose heart delighteth not in pleasure, but in action finds delight,
He wipes away his kinsmen's grief and stands the pillar of their might.


Effort brings fortune's sure increase,
Its absence brings to nothingness.


In sluggishness is seen misfortune's lurid form, the wise declare;
Where man unslothful toils, she of the lotus flower is there!


'Tis no reproach unpropitious fate should ban;
But not to do man's work is foul disgrace to man!


Though fate-divine should make your labour vain;
Effort its labour's sure reward will gain.


Who strive with undismayed, unfaltering mind,
At length shall leave opposing fate behind.


Smile, with patient, hopeful heart, in troublous hour;
Meet and so vanquish grief; nothing hath equal power.


Though sorrow, like a flood, comes rolling on,
When wise men's mind regards it,- it is gone.


Who griefs confront with meek, ungrieving heart,
From them griefs, put to grief, depart.


Like bullock struggle on through each obstructed way;
From such an one will troubles, troubled, roll away.


When griefs press on, but fail to crush the patient heart,
Then griefs defeated, put to grief, depart.


Who boasted not of wealth, nor gave it all their heart,
Will not bemoan the loss, when prosperous days depart.


'Man's frame is sorrow's target', the noble mind reflects,
Nor meets with troubled mind the sorrows it expects.


He seeks not joy, to sorrow man is born, he knows;
Such man will walk unharmed by touch of human woes.


Mid joys he yields not heart to joys' control.
Mid sorrows, sorrow cannot touch his soul.


Who pain as pleasure takes, he shall acquire
The bliss to which his foes in vain aspire.


A minister is he who grasps, with wisdom large,
Means, time, work's mode, and functions rare he must discharge.


A minister must greatness own of guardian power, determined mind,
Learn'd wisdom, manly effort with the former five combined.


A minister is he whose power can foes divide,
Attach more firmly friends, of severed ones can heal the breaches wide.


A minister has power to see the methods help afford,
To ponder long, then utter calm conclusive word.


The man who virtue knows, has use of wise and pleasant words.
With plans for every season apt, in counsel aid affords.


When native subtilty combines with sound scholastic lore,
'Tis subtilty surpassing all, which nothing stands before.


Though knowing all that books can teach, 'tis truest tact
To follow common sense of men in act.


'Tis duty of the man in place aloud to say
The very truth, though unwise king may cast his words away.


A minister who by king's side plots evil things
Worse woes than countless foemen brings.


For gain of end desired just counsel nought avails
To minister, when tact in execution fails.


A tongue that rightly speaks the right is greatest gain,
It stands alone midst goodly things that men obtain.


Since gain and loss in life on speech depend,
From careless slip in speech thyself defend.


'Tis speech that spell-bound holds the listening ear,
While those who have not heard desire to hear.


Speak words adapted well to various hearers' state;
No higher virtue lives, no gain more surely great.


Speak out your speech, when once 'tis past dispute
That none can utter speech that shall your speech refute.


Charming each hearer's ear, of others' words to seize the sense,
Is method wise of men of spotless excellence.


Mighty in word, of unforgetful mind, of fearless speech,
'Tis hard for hostile power such man to overreach.


Swiftly the listening world will gather round,
When men of mighty speech the weighty theme propound.


Who have not skill ten faultless words to utter plain,
Their tongues will itch with thousand words man's ears to pain.


Like scentless flower in blooming garland bound
Are men who can't their lore acquired to other's ears expound.


The good external help confers is worldly gain;
By action good men every needed gift obtain.


From action evermore thyself restrain
Of glory and of good that yields no gain.


Who tell themselves that nobler things shall yet be won
All deeds that dim the light of glory must they shun.


Though troubles press, no shameful deed they do,
Whose eyes the ever-during vision view.


Do nought that soul repenting must deplore,
If thou hast sinned, 'tis well if thou dost sin no more.


Though her that bore thee hung'ring thou behold, no deed
Do thou, that men of perfect soul have crime decreed.


Than store of wealth guilt-laden souls obtain,
The sorest poverty of perfect soul is richer gain.


To those who hate reproof and do forbidden thing.
What prospers now, in after days shall anguish bring.


What's gained through tears with tears shall go;
From loss good deeds entail harvests of blessings grow.


In pot of clay unburnt he water pours and would retain,
Who seeks by wrong the realm in wealth and safety to maintain.


What men call 'power in action' know for 'power of mind'
Externe to man all other aids you find.


'Each hindrance shun', 'unyielding onward press, If obstacle be there,'
These two define your way, so those that search out truth declare.


Man's fitting work is known but by success achieved;
In midst the plan revealed brings ruin ne'er to be retrieved.


Easy to every man the speech that shows the way;
Hard thing to shape one's life by words they say!


The power in act of men renowned and great,
With king acceptance finds and fame through all the state.


Whate'er men think, ev'n as they think, may men obtain,
If those who think can steadfastness of will retain.


Despise not men of modest bearing; Look not at form, but what men are:
For some there live, high functions sharing, Like linch-pin of the mighty car!


What clearly eye discerns as right, with steadfast will,
And mind unslumbering, that should man fulfil.


Though toil and trouble face thee, firm resolve hold fast,
And do the deeds that pleasure yield at last.


The world desires not men of every power possessed,
Who power in act desire not,- crown of all the rest.


Benevolence high birth, the courtesy kings love:-
These qualities the envoy of a king approve.


Love, knowledge, power of chosen words, three things,
Should he possess who speaks the words of kings.


Mighty in lore amongst the learned must he be,
Midst jav'lin-bearing kings who speaks the words of victory.


Sense, goodly grace, and knowledge exquisite.
Who hath these three for envoy's task is fit.


In terms concise, avoiding wrathful speech, who utters pleasant word,
An envoy he who gains advantage for his lord.


An envoy meet is he, well-learned, of fearless eye
Who speaks right home, prepared for each emergency.


He is the best who knows what's due, the time considered well,
The place selects, then ponders long ere he his errand tell.


Integrity, resources, soul determined, truthfulness.
Who rightly speaks his message must these marks possess.


His faltering lips must utter no unworthy thing,
Who stands, with steady eye, to speak the mandates of his king.


Death to the faithful one his embassy may bring;
To envoy gains assured advantage for his king.


Who warm them at the fire draw not too near, nor keep too much aloof;
Thus let them act who dwell beneath of warlike kings the palace-roof.


To those who prize not state that kings are wont to prize,
The king himself abundant wealth supplies.


Who would walk warily, let him of greater faults beware;
To clear suspicions once aroused is an achievement rare.


All whispered words and interchange of smiles repress,
In presence of the men who kingly power possess.


Seek not, ask not, the secret of the king to hear;
But if he lets the matter forth, give ear!


Knowing the signs, waiting for fitting time, with courteous care,
Things not displeasing, needful things, declare.


Speak pleasant things, but never utter idle word;
Not though by monarch's ears with pleasure heard.


Say not, 'He's young, my kinsman,' despising thus your king;
But reverence the glory kingly state doth bring.


'We've gained his grace, boots nought what graceless acts we do',
So deem not sages who the changeless vision view.


Who think 'We're ancient friends' and do unseemly things;
To these familiarity sure ruin brings.


Who knows the sign, and reads unuttered thought, the gem is he,
Of earth round traversed by the changeless sea.


Undoubting, who the minds of men can scan,
As deity regard that gifted man.


Who by the sign the signs interprets plain,
Give any member up his aid to gain.


Who reads what's shown by signs, though words unspoken be,
In form may seem as other men, in function nobler far is he.


By sign who knows not sings to comprehend, what gain,
'Mid all his members, from his eyes does he obtain?


As forms around in crystal mirrored clear we find,
The face will show what's throbbing in the mind.


Than speaking countenance hath aught more prescient skill?
Rejoice or burn with rage, 'tis the first herald still!


To see the face is quite enough, in presence brought,
When men can look within and know the lurking thought.


The eye speaks out the hate or friendly soul of man;
To those who know the eye's swift varying moods to scan.


The men of keen discerning soul no other test apply
(When you their secret ask) than man's revealing eye.


Men pure in heart, who know of words the varied force,
Should to their audience known adapt their well-arranged discourse.


Good men to whom the arts of eloquence are known,
Should seek occasion meet, and say what well they've made their own.


Unversed in councils, who essays to speak.
Knows not the way of suasive words,- and all is weak.


Before the bright ones shine as doth the light!
Before the dull ones be as purest stucco white!


Midst all good things the best is modest grace,
That speaks not first before the elders' face.


As in the way one tottering falls, is slip before
The men whose minds are filled with varied lore.


The learning of the learned sage shines bright
To those whose faultless skill can value it aright.


To speak where understanding hearers you obtain,
Is sprinkling water on the fields of growing grain!


In councils of the good, who speak good things with penetrating power,
In councils of the mean, let them say nought, e'en in oblivious hour.


Ambrosia in the sewer spilt, is word
Spoken in presence of the alien herd.


Men, pure in heart, who know of words the varied force,
The mighty council's moods discern, nor fail in their discourse.


Who what they've learned, in penetrating words heve learned to say,
Before the learn'd among the learn'd most learn'd are they.


Many encountering death in face of foe will hold their ground;
Who speak undaunted in the council hall are rarely found.


What you have learned, in penetrating words speak out before
The learn'd; but learn what men more learn'd can teach you more.


By rule, to dialectic art your mind apply,
That in the council fearless you may make an apt reply.


To those who lack the hero's eye what can the sword avail?
Or science what, to those before the council keen who quail?


As shining sword before the foe which 'sexless being' bears,
Is science learned by him the council's face who fears.


Though many things they've learned, yet useless are they all,
To man who cannot well and strongly speak in council hall.


Who, though they've learned, before the council of the good men quake,
Than men unlearn'd a lower place must take.


Who what they've learned, in penetrating words know not to say,
The council fearing, though they live, as dead are they.



Where spreads fertility unfailing, where resides a band,
Of virtuous men, and those of ample wealth, call that a 'land'


That is a 'land' which men desire for wealth's abundant share,
Yielding rich increase, where calamities are rare.


When burthens press, it bears; Yet, With unfailing hand
To king due tribute pays: that is the 'land'


That is a 'land' whose peaceful annals know,
Nor famine fierce, nor wasting plague, nor ravage of the foe.


From factions free, and desolating civil strife, and band
Of lurking murderers that king afflict, that is the 'land'.


Chief of all lands is that, where nought disturbs its peace;
Or, if invaders come, still yields its rich increase.


Waters from rains and springs, a mountain near, and waters thence;
These make a land, with fortress' sure defence.


A country's jewels are these five: unfailing health,
Fertility, and joy, a sure defence, and wealth.


That is a land that yields increase unsought,
That is no land whose gifts with toil are bought.


Though blest with all these varied gifts' increase,
A land gains nought that is not with its king at peace.


A fort is wealth to those who act against their foes;
Is wealth to them who, fearing, guard themselves from woes.


A fort is that which owns fount of waters crystal clear,
An open space, a hill, and shade of beauteous forest near.


Height, breadth, strength, difficult access:
Science declares a fort must these possess.


A fort must need but slight defence, yet ample be,
Defying all the foeman's energy.


Impregnable, containing ample stores of food,
A fort for those within, must be a warlike station good.


A fort, with all munitions amply stored,
In time of need should good reserves afford.


A fort should be impregnable to foes who gird it round,
Or aim there darts from far, or mine beneath the ground.


Howe'er the circling foe may strive access to win,
A fort should give the victory to those who guard within.


At outset of the strife a fort should foes dismay;
And greatness gain by deeds in every glorious day.


Howe'er majestic castled walls may rise,
To craven souls no fortress strength supplies.


Nothing exists save wealth, that can
Change man of nought to worthy man.


Those who have nought all will despise;
All raise the wealthy to the skies.


Wealth, the lamp unfailing, speeds to every land,
Dispersing darkness at its lord's command.


Their wealth, who blameless means can use aright,
Is source of virtue and of choice delight.


Wealth gained by loss of love and grace,
Let man cast off from his embrace.


Wealth that falls to him as heir, wealth from the kingdom's dues,
The spoils of slaughtered foes; these are the royal revenues.


'Tis love that kindliness as offspring bears:
And wealth as bounteous nurse the infant rears.


As one to view the strife of elephants who takes his stand,
On hill he's climbed, is he who works with money in his hand.


Make money! Foeman's insolence o'ergrown
To lop away no keener steel is known.


Who plenteous store of glorious wealth have gained,
By them the other two are easily obtained.


A conquering host, complete in all its limbs, that fears no wound,
Mid treasures of the king is chiefest found.


In adverse hour, to face undaunted might of conquering foe,
Is bravery that only veteran host can show.


Though, like the sea, the angry mice send forth their battle cry;
What then? The dragon breathes upon them, and they die!


That is a host, by no defeats, by no desertions shamed,
For old hereditary courage famed.


That is a 'host' that joins its ranks, and mightily withstands,
Though death with sudden wrath should fall upon its bands.


Valour with honour, sure advance in glory's path, with confidence;
To warlike host these four are sure defence.


A valiant army bears the onslaught, onward goes,
Well taught with marshalled ranks to meet their coming foes.


Though not in war offensive or defensive skilled;
An army gains applause when well equipped and drilled.


Where weakness, clinging fear and poverty
Are not, the host will gain the victory.


Though men abound, all ready for the war,
No army is where no fit leaders are.


Ye foes! stand not before my lord! for many a one
Who did my lord withstand, now stands in stone!


Who aims at elephant, though dart should fail, has greater praise.
Than he who woodland hare with winged arrow slays.


Fierceness in hour of strife heroic greatness shows;
Its edge is kindness to our suffering foes.


At elephant he hurls the dart in hand; for weapon pressed,
He laughs and plucks the javelin from his wounded breast.


To hero fearless must it not defeat appear,
If he but wink his eye when foemen hurls his spear.


The heroes, counting up their days, set down as vain
Each day when they no glorious wound sustain.


Who seek for world-wide fame, regardless of their life,
The glorious clasp adorns, sign of heroic strife.


Fearless they rush where'er 'the tide of battle rolls';
The king's reproof damps not the ardour of their eager souls.


Who says they err, and visits them scorn,
Who die and faithful guard the vow they've sworn?


If monarch's eyes o'erflow with tears for hero slain,
Who would not beg such boon of glorious death to gain?


What so hard for men to gain as friendship true?
What so sure defence 'gainst all that foe can do?


Friendship with men fulfilled of good Waxes like the crescent moon;
Friendship with men of foolish mood, Like the full orb, waneth soon.


Learned scroll the more you ponder, Sweeter grows the mental food;
So the heart by use grows fonder, Bound in friendship with the good.


Nor for laughter only friendship all the pleasant day,
But for strokes of sharp reproving, when from right you stray.


Not association constant, not affection's token bind;
'Tis the unison of feeling friends unites of kindred mind.


Not the face's smile of welcome shows the friend sincere,
But the heart's rejoicing gladness when the friend is near.


Friendship from ruin saves, in way of virtue keeps;
In troublous time, it weeps with him who weeps.


As hand of him whose vesture slips away,
Friendship at once the coming grief will stay.


And where is friendship's royal seat? In stable mind,
Where friend in every time of need support may find.


Mean is the friendship that men blazon forth,
'He's thus to me' and 'such to him my worth'.


To make an untried man your friend is ruin sure;
For friendship formed unbroken must endure.


Alliance with the man you have not proved and proved again,
In length of days will give you mortal pain.


Temper, descent, defects, associations free
From blame: know these, then let the man be friend to thee.


Who, born of noble race, from guilt would shrink with shame,
Pay any price so you as friend that man may claim.


Make them your chosen friend whose words repentance move,
With power prescription's path to show, while evil they reprove.


Ruin itself one blessing lends:
'Tis staff that measures out one's friends.


'Tis gain to any man, the sages say,
Friendship of fools to put away.


Think not the thoughts that dwarf the soul; nor take
For friends the men who friends in time of grief forsake.


Of friends deserting us on ruin's brink,
'Tis torture e'en in life's last hour to think.


Cling to the friendship of the spotless one's; whate'er you pay.
Renounce alliance with the men of evil way.


Familiarity is friendship's silent pact,
That puts restraint on no familiar act.


Familiar freedom friendship's very frame supplies;
To be its savour sweet is duty of the wise.


When to familiar acts men kind response refuse,
What fruit from ancient friendship's use?


When friends unbidden do familiar acts with loving heart,
Friends take the kindly deed in friendly part.


Not folly merely, but familiar carelessness,
Esteem it, when your friends cause you distress.


Who stand within the bounds quit not, though loss impends,
Association with the old familiar friends.


True friends, well versed in loving ways,
Cease not to love, when friend their love betrays.


In strength of friendship rare of friend's disgrace who will not hear,
The day his friend offends will day of grace to him appear.


Friendship of old and faithful friends,
Who ne'er forsake, the world commends.


Ill-wishers even wish them well, who guard.
For ancient friends, their wonted kind regard.


Though evil men should all-absorbing friendship show,
Their love had better die away than grow.


What though you gain or lose friendship of men of alien heart,
Who when you thrive are friends, and when you fail depart?


These are alike: the friends who ponder friendship's gain
Those who accept whate'er you give, and all the plundering train.


A steed untrained will leave you in the tug of war;
Than friends like that to dwell alone is better far.


'Tis better not to gain than gain the friendship profitless
Of men of little minds, who succour fails when dangers press.


Better ten million times incur the wise man's hate,
Than form with foolish men a friendship intimate.


From foes ten million fold a greater good you gain,
Than friendship yields that's formed with laughers vain.


Those men who make a grievous toil of what they do
On your behalf, their friendship silently eschew.


E'en in a dream the intercourse is bitterness
With men whose deeds are other than their words profess.


In anywise maintain not intercourse with those,
Who in the house are friends, in hall are slandering foes.


Anvil where thou shalt smitten be, when men occasion find,
Is friendship's form without consenting mind.


Friendship of those who seem our kin, but are not really kind.
Will change from hour to hour like woman's mind.


To heartfelt goodness men ignoble hardly may attain,
Although abundant stores of goodly lore they gain.


'Tis fitting you should dread dissemblers' guile,
Whose hearts are bitter while their faces smile.


When minds are not in unison, 'its never; just,
In any words men speak to put your trust.


Though many goodly words they speak in friendly tone,
The words of foes will speedily be known.


To pliant speech from hostile lips give thou no ear;
'Tis pliant bow that show the deadly peril near!


In hands that worship weapon ten hidden lies;
Such are the tears that fall from foeman's eyes.


'Tis just, when men make much of you, and then despise,
To make them smile, and slap in friendship's guise.


When time shall come that foes as friends appear,
Then thou, to hide a hostile heart, a smiling face may'st wear.



What one thing merits folly's special name.
Letting gain go, loss for one's own to claim!


'Mid follies chiefest folly is to fix your love
On deeds which to your station unbefitting prove.


Ashamed of nothing, searching nothing out, of loveless heart,
Nought cherishing, 'tis thus the fool will play his part.


The sacred law he reads and learns, to other men expounds,-
Himself obeys not; where can greater fool be found?


The fool will merit hell in one brief life on earth,
In which he entering sinks through sevenfold round of birth.


When fool some task attempts with uninstructed pains,
It fails; nor that alone, himself he binds with chains.


When fools are blessed with fortune's bounteous store,
Their foes feed full, their friends are prey to hunger sore.


When folly's hand grasps wealth's increase, 'twill be
As when a mad man raves in drunken glee.


Friendship of fools is very pleasant thing,
Parting with them will leave behind no sting.


Like him who seeks his couch with unwashed feet,
Is fool whose foot intrudes where wise men meet.


Want of knowledge, 'mid all wants the sorest want we deem;
Want of other things the world will not as want esteem.


The gift of foolish man, with willing heart bestowed, is nought,
But blessing by receiver's penance bought.


With keener anguish foolish men their own hearts wring,
Than aught that even malice of their foes can bring.


What is stupidity? The arrogance that cries,
'Behold, we claim the glory of the wise.'


If men what they have never learned assume to know,
Upon their real learning's power a doubt 'twill throw.


Fools are they who their nakedness conceal,
And yet their faults unveiled reveal.


From out his soul who lets the mystic teachings die,
Entails upon himself abiding misery.


Advised, he heeds not; of himself knows nothing wise;
This man's whole life is all one plague until he dies.


That man is blind to eyes that will not see who knowledge shows;-
The blind man still in his blind fashion knows.


Who what the world affirms as false proclaim,
O'er all the earth receive a demon's name.


Hostility disunion's plague will bring,
That evil quality, to every living thing.


Though men disunion plan, and do thee much despite
'Tis best no enmity to plan, nor evil deeds requite.


If enmity, that grievous plague, you shun,
Endless undying praises shall be won.


Joy of joys abundant grows,
When malice dies that woe of woes.


If men from enmity can keep their spirits free,
Who over them shall gain the victory?


The life of those who cherished enmity hold dear,
To grievous fault and utter death is near.


The very truth that greatness gives their eyes can never see,
Who only know to work men woe, fulfilled of enmity.


'Tis gain to turn the soul from enmity;
Ruin reigns where this hath mastery.


Men think not hostile thought in fortune's favouring hour,
They cherish enmity when in misfortune's power.


From enmity do all afflictive evils flow;
But friendliness doth wealth of kindly good bestow.


With stronger than thyself, turn from the strife away;
With weaker shun not, rather court the fray.


No kinsman's love, no strength of friends has he;
How can he bear his foeman's enmity?


A craven thing! knows nought, accords with none, gives nought away;
To wrath of any foe he falls an easy prey.


His wrath still blazes, every secret told; each day
This man's in every place to every foe an easy prey.


No way of right he scans, no precepts bind, no crimes affright,
No grace of good he owns; such man's his foes' delight.


Blind in his rage, his lustful passions rage and swell;
If such a man mislikes you, like it well.


Unseemly are his deeds, yet proffering aid, the man draws nigh:
His hate- 'tis cheap at any price- be sure to buy!


No gracious gifts he owns, faults many cloud his fame;
His foes rejoice, for none with kindred claim.


The joy of victory is never far removed from those
Who've luck to meet with ignorant and timid foes.


The task of angry war with men unlearned in virtue's lore
Who will not meet, glory shall meet him never more.


For Hate, that ill-conditioned thing not e'en in jest.
Let any evil longing rule your breast.


Although you hate incur of those whose ploughs are bows,
Make not the men whose ploughs are words your foes!


Than men of mind diseased, a wretch more utterly forlorn,
Is he who stands alone, object of many foeman's scorn.


The world secure on his dexterity depends,
Whose worthy rule can change his foes to friends.


Without ally, who fights with twofold enemy o'ermatched,
Must render one of these a friend attached.


Whether you trust or not, in time of sore distress,
Questions of diff'rence or agreement cease to press.


To those who know them not, complain not of your woes;
Nor to your foeman's eyes infirmities disclose.


Know thou the way, then do thy part, thyself defend;
Thus shall the pride of those that hate thee have an end.


Destroy the thorn, while tender point can work thee no offence;
Matured by time, 'twill pierce the hand that plucks it thence.


But breathe upon them, and they surely die,
Who fail to tame the pride of angry enemy.


Water and shade, if they unwholesome prove, will bring you pain.
And qualities of friends who treacherous act, will be your bane.


Dread not the foes that as drawn swords appear;
Friendship of foes, who seem like kinsmen, fear!


Of hidden hate beware, and guard thy life;
In troublous time 'twill deeper wound than potter's knife.


If secret enmities arise that minds pervert,
Then even kin unkind will work thee grievous hurt.


Amid one's relatives if hidden hath arise,
'Twill hurt inflict in deadly wise.


If discord finds a place midst those who dwelt at one before,
'Tis ever hard to keep destruction from the door.


As casket with its cover, though in one they live alway,
No union to the house where hate concealed hath sway.


As gold with which the file contends is worn away,
So strength of house declines where hate concealed hath sway.


Though slight as shred of 'seasame' seed it be,
Destruction lurks in hidden enmity.


Domestic life with those who don't agree,
Is dwelling in a shed with snake for company.



The chiefest care of those who guard themselves from ill,
Is not to slight the powers of those who work their mighty will.


If men will lead their lives reckless of great men's will,
Such life, through great men's powers, will bring perpetual ill.


Who ruin covet let them shut their ears, and do despite
To those who, where they list to ruin have the might.


When powerless man 'gainst men of power will evil deeds essay,
Tis beck'ning with the hand for Death to seize them for its prey.


Who dare the fiery wrath of monarchs dread,
Where'er they flee, are numbered with the dead.


Though in the conflagration caught, he may escape from thence:
He 'scapes not who in life to great ones gives offence.


Though every royal gift, and stores of wealth your life should crown,
What are they, if the worthy men of mighty virtue frown?


If they, whose virtues like a mountain rise, are light esteemed;
They die from earth who, with their households, ever-during seemed.


When blazes forth the wrath of men of lofty fame,
Kings even fall from high estate and perish in the flame.


Though all-surpassing wealth of aid the boast,
If men in glorious virtue great are wrath, they're lost.


Who give their soul to love of wife acquire not nobler gain;
Who give their soul to strenuous deeds such meaner joys disdain.


Who gives himself to love of wife, careless of noble name
His wealth will clothe him with o'erwhelming shame.


Who to his wife submits, his strange, unmanly mood
Will daily bring him shame among the good.


No glory crowns e'en manly actions wrought
By him who dreads his wife, nor gives the other world a thought.


Who quakes before his wife will ever tremble too,
Good deeds to men of good deserts to do.


Though, like the demi-gods, in bliss they dwell secure from harm,
Those have no dignity who fear the housewife's slender arm.


The dignity of modest womanhood excels
His manliness, obedient to a woman's law who dwells.


Who to the will of her with beauteous brow their lives conform,
Aid not their friends in need, nor acts of charity perform.


No virtuous deed, no seemly wealth, no pleasure, rests
With them who live obedient to their wives' behests.


Where pleasures of the mind, that dwell in realms of thought, abound,
Folly, that springs from overweening woman's love, is never found.


Those that choice armlets wear who seek not thee with love,
But seek thy wealth, their pleasant words will ruin prove.


Who weigh the gain, and utter virtuous words with vicious heart,
Weighing such women's worth, from their society depart.


As one in darkened room, some stranger corpse inarms,
Is he who seeks delight in mercenary women's charms!


Their worthless charms, whose only weal is wealth of gain,
From touch of these the wise, who seek the wealth of grace, abstain.


From contact with their worthless charms, whose charms to all are free,
The men with sense of good and lofty wisdom blest will flee;


From touch of those who worthless charms, with wanton arts, display,
The men who would their own true good maintain will turn away.


Who cherish alien thoughts while folding in their feigned embrace,
These none approach save those devoid of virtue's grace.


As demoness who lures to ruin woman's treacherous love
To men devoid of wisdom's searching power will prove.


The wanton's tender arm, with gleaming jewels decked,
Is hell, where sink degraded souls of men abject.


Women of double minds, strong drink, and dice; to these giv'n o'er,
Are those on whom the light of Fortune shines no more.


Who love the palm's intoxicating juice, each day,
No rev'rence they command, their glory fades away.


Drink not inebriating draught. Let him count well the cost.
Who drinks, by drinking, all good men's esteem is lost.


The drunkard's joy is sorrow to his mother's eyes;
What must it be in presence of the truly wise?


Shame, goodly maid, will turn her back for aye on them
Who sin the drunkard's grievous sin, that all condemn.


With gift of goods who self-oblivion buys,
Is ignorant of all that man should prize.


Sleepers are as the dead, no otherwise they seem;
Who drink intoxicating draughts, they poison quaff, we deem.


Who turn aside to drink, and droop their heavy eye,
Shall be their townsmen's jest, when they the fault espy.


No more in secret drink, and then deny thy hidden fraud;
What in thy mind lies hid shall soon be known abroad.


Like him who, lamp in hand, would seek one sunk beneath the wave.
Is he who strives to sober drunken man with reasonings grave.


When one, in sober interval, a drunken man espies,
Does he not think, 'Such is my folly in my revelries'?


Seek not the gamester's play; though you should win,
Your gain is as the baited hook the fish takes in.


Is there for gamblers, too, that gaining one a hundred lose, some way
That they may good obtain, and see a prosperous day?


If prince unceasing speak of nought but play,
Treasure and revenue will pass from him away.


Gaming brings many woes, and ruins fair renown;
Nothing to want brings men so surely down.


The dice, and gaming-hall, and gamester's art, they eager sought,
Thirsting for gain- the men in other days who came to nought.


Gambling's Misfortune's other name: o'er whom she casts her veil,
They suffer grievous want, and sorrows sore bewail.


Ancestral wealth and noble fame to ruin haste,
If men in gambler's halls their precious moments waste.


Gambling wastes wealth, to falsehood bends the soul: it drives away
All grace, and leaves the man to utter misery a prey.


Clothes, wealth, food, praise, and learning, all depart
From him on gambler's gain who sets his heart.


Howe'er he lose, the gambler's heart is ever in the play;
E'en so the soul, despite its griefs, would live on earth alway.



The learned books count three, with wind as first; of these,
As any one prevail, or fail; 'twill cause disease.


No need of medicine to heal your body's pain,
If, what you ate before digested well, you eat again.


Who has a body gained may long the gift retain,
If, food digested well, in measure due he eat again.


Knowing the food digested well, when hunger prompteth thee,
With constant care, the viands choose that well agree.


With self-denial take the well-selected meal;
So shall thy frame no sudden sickness feel.


On modest temperance as pleasures pure,
So pain attends the greedy epicure.


Who largely feeds, nor measure of the fire within maintains,
That thoughtless man shall feel unmeasured pains.


Disease, its cause, what may abate the ill:
Let leech examine these, then use his skill.


The habitudes of patient and disease, the crises of the ill
These must the learned leech think over well, then use his skill.


For patient, leech, and remedies, and him who waits by patient's side,
The art of medicine must fourfold code of laws provide.



Save in the scions of a noble house, you never find
Instinctive sense of right and virtuous shame combined.


In these three things the men of noble birth fail not:
In virtuous deed and truthful word, and chastened thought.


The smile, the gift, the pleasant word, unfailing courtesy
These are the signs, they say, of true nobility.


Millions on millions piled would never win
The men of noble race to soul-degrading sin.


Though stores for charity should fail within, the ancient race
Will never lose its old ancestral grace.


Whose minds are set to live as fits their sire's unspotted fame,
Stooping to low deceit, commit no deeds that gender shame.


The faults of men of noble race are seen by every eye,
As spots on her bright orb that walks sublime the evening sky.


If lack of love appear in those who bear some goodly name,
'Twill make men doubt the ancestry they claim.


Of soil the plants that spring thereout will show the worth:
The words they speak declare the men of noble birth.


Who seek for good the grace of virtuous shame must know;
Who seek for noble name to all must reverence show.


Though linked to splendours man no otherwise may gain,
Reject each act that may thine honour's clearness stain.


Who seek with glory to combine honour's untarnished fame,
Do no inglorious deeds, though men accord them glory's name.


Bow down thy soul, with increase blest, in happy hour;
Lift up thy heart, when stript of all by fortune's power.


Like hairs from off the head that fall to earth,
When fall'n from high estate are men of noble birth.


If meanness, slight as 'abrus' grain, by men be wrought,
Though like a hill their high estate, they sink to nought.


It yields no praise, nor to the land of Gods throws wide the gate:
Why follow men who scorn, and at their bidding wait?


Better 'twere said, 'He's perished!' than to gain
The means to live, following in foeman's train.


When high estate has lost its pride of honour meet,
Is life, that nurses this poor flesh, as nectar sweet?


Like the wild ox that, of its tuft bereft, will pine away,
Are those who, of their honour shorn, will quit the light of day.


Who, when dishonour comes, refuse to live, their honoured memory
Will live in worship and applause of all the world for aye!


The light of life is mental energy; disgrace is his
Who says, 'I 'ill lead a happy life devoid of this.'


All men that live are one in circumstances of birth;
Diversities of works give each his special worth.


The men of lofty line, whose souls are mean, are never great
The men of lowly birth, when high of soul, are not of low estate.


Like single-hearted women, greatness too,
Exists while to itself is true.


The man endowed with greatness true,
Rare deeds in perfect wise will do.


'As votaries of the truly great we will ourselves enroll,'
Is thought that enters not the mind of men of little soul.


Whene'er distinction lights on some unworthy head,
Then deeds of haughty insolence are bred.


Greatness humbly bends, but littleness always
Spreads out its plumes, and loads itself with praise.


Greatness is absence of conceit; meanness, we deem,
Riding on car of vanity supreme.


Greatness will hide a neighbour's shame;
Meanness his faults to all the world proclaim.


All goodly things are duties to the men, they say
Who set themselves to walk in virtue's perfect way.


The good of inward excellence they claim,
The perfect men; all other good is only good in name.


Love, modesty, beneficence, benignant grace,
With truth, are pillars five of perfect virtue's resting-place.


The type of 'penitence' is virtuous good that nothing slays;
To speak no ill of other men is perfect virtue's praise.


Submission is the might of men of mighty acts; the sage
With that same weapon stills his foeman's rage.


What is perfection's test? The equal mind.
To bear repulse from even meaner men resigned.


What fruit doth your perfection yield you, say!
Unless to men who work you ill good repay?


To soul with perfect virtue's strength endued,
Brings no disgrace the lack of every earthly good.


Call them of perfect virtue's sea the shore,
Who, though the fates should fail, fail not for evermore.


The mighty earth its burthen to sustain must cease,
If perfect virtue of the perfect men decrease.


Who easy access give to every man, they say,
Of kindly courtesy will learn with ease the way.


Benevolence and high born dignity,
These two are beaten paths of courtesy.


Men are not one because their members seem alike to outward view;
Similitude of kindred quality makes likeness true.


Of men of fruitful life, who kindly benefits dispense,
The world unites to praise the 'noble excellence.'


Contempt is evil though in sport. They who man's nature know,
E'en in their wrath, a courteous mind will show.


The world abides; for 'worthy' men its weight sustain.
Were it not so, 'twould fall to dust again.


Though sharp their wit as file, as blocks they must remain,
Whose souls are void of 'courtesy humane'.


Though men with all unfriendly acts and wrongs assail,
'Tis uttermost disgrace in 'courtesy' to fail.


To him who knows not how to smile in kindly mirth,
Darkness in daytime broods o'er all the vast and mighty earth.


Like sweet milk soured because in filthy vessel poured,
Is ample wealth in churlish man's unopened coffers stored.


Who fills his house with ample store, enjoying none,
Is dead. Nought with the useless heap is done.


Who giving nought, opines from wealth all blessing springs,
Degraded birth that doting miser's folly brings.


Who lust to heap up wealth, but glory hold not dear,
It burthens earth when on the stage of being they appear.


Whom no one loves, when he shall pass away,
What doth he look to leave behind, I pray?


Amid accumulated millions they are poor,
Who nothing give and nought enjoy of all they store.


Their ample wealth is misery to men of churlish heart,
Who nought themselves enjoy, and nought to worthy men impart.


Like woman fair in lonelihood who aged grows,
Is wealth of him on needy men who nought bestows.


When he whom no man loves exults in great prosperity,
'Tis as when fruits in midmost of the town some poisonous tree.


Who love abandon, self-afflict, and virtue's way forsake
To heap up glittering wealth, their hoards shall others take.


'Tis as when rain cloud in the heaven grows day,
When generous wealthy man endures brief poverty.


To shrink abashed from evil deed is 'generous shame';
Other is that of bright-browed one of virtuous fame.


Food, clothing, and other things alike all beings own;
By sense of shame the excellence of men is known.


All spirits homes of flesh as habitation claim,
And perfect virtue ever dwells with shame.


And is not shame an ornament to men of dignity?
Without it step of stately pride is piteous thing to see.


As home of virtuous shame by all the world the men are known,
Who feel ashamed for others, guilt as for their own.


Unless the hedge of shame inviolate remain,
For men of lofty soul the earth's vast realms no charms retain.


The men of modest soul for shame would life an offering make,
But ne'er abandon virtuous shame for life's dear sake.


Though know'st no shame, while all around asha med must be:
Virtue will shrink away ashamed of thee!


'Twill race consume if right observance fail;
'Twill every good consume if shamelessness prevail.


'Tis as with strings a wooden puppet apes life's functions, when
Those void of shame within hold intercourse with men.


Who says 'I'll do my work, nor slack my hand',
His greatness, clothed with dignity supreme, shall stand.


The manly act and knowledge full, when these combine
In deed prolonged, then lengthens out the race's line.


'I'll make my race renowned,' if man shall say,
With vest succinct the goddess leads the way.


Who labours for his race with unremitting pain,
Without a thought spontaneously, his end will gain.


With blameless life who seeks to build his race's fame,
The world shall circle him, and kindred claim.


Of virtuous manliness the world accords the praise
To him who gives his powers, the house from which he sprang to raise.


The fearless hero bears the brunt amid the warrior throng;
Amid his kindred so the burthen rests upon the strong.


Wait for no season, when you would your house uprear;
'Twill perish, if you wait supine, or hold your honour dear.


Is not his body vase that various sorrows fill,
Who would his household screen from every ill?


When trouble the foundation saps the house must fall,
If no strong hand be nigh to prop the tottering wall.


Howe'er they roam, the world must follow still the plougher's team;
Though toilsome, culture of the ground as noblest toil esteem.


The ploughers are the linch-pin of the world; they bear
Them up who other works perform, too weak its toils to share.


Who ploughing eat their food, they truly live:
The rest to others bend subservient, eating what they give.


O'er many a land they 'll see their monarch reign,
Whose fields are shaded by the waving grain.


They nothing ask from others, but to askers give,
Who raise with their own hands the food on which they live.


For those who 've left what all men love no place is found,
When they with folded hands remain who till the ground.


Reduce your soil to that dry state, When ounce is quarter-ounce's weight;
Without one handful of manure, Abundant crops you thus secure.


To cast manure is better than to plough;
Weed well; to guard is more than watering now


When master from the field aloof hath stood;
Then land will sulk, like wife in angry mood.


The earth, that kindly dame, will laugh to see,
Men seated idle pleading poverty.


You ask what sharper pain than poverty is known;
Nothing pains more than poverty, save poverty alone.


Malefactor matchless! poverty destroys
This world's and the next world's joys.


Importunate desire, which poverty men name,
Destroys both old descent and goodly fame.


From penury will spring, 'mid even those of noble race,
Oblivion that gives birth to words that bring disgrace.


From poverty, that grievous woe,
Attendant sorrows plenteous grow.


Though deepest sense, well understood, the poor man's words convey,
Their sense from memory of mankind will fade away.


From indigence devoid of virtue's grace,
The mother e'en that bare, estranged, will turn her face.


And will it come today as yesterday,
The grief of want that eats my soul away?


Amid the flames sleep may men's eyelids close,
In poverty the eye knows no repose.


Unless the destitute will utterly themselves deny,
They cause their neighbour's salt and vinegar to die.


When those you find from whom 'tis meet to ask,- for aid apply;
Theirs is the sin, not yours, if they the gift deny.


Even to ask an alms may pleasure give,
If what you ask without annoyance you receive.


The men who nought deny, but know what's due, before their face
To stand as suppliants affords especial grace.


Like giving alms, may even asking pleasant seem,
From men who of denial never even dream.


Because on earth the men exist, who never say them nay,
Men bear to stand before their eyes for help to pray.


It those you find from evil of 'denial' free,
At once all plague of poverty will flee.


If men are found who give and no harsh words of scorn employ,
The minds of askers, through and through, will thrill with joy.


If askers cease, the mighty earth, where cooling fountains flow,
Will be a stage where wooden puppets come and go.


What glory will there be to men of generous soul,
When none are found to love the askers' role?


Askers refused from wrath must stand aloof;
The plague of poverty itself is ample proof.


Ten million-fold 'tis greater gain, asking no alms to live,
Even from those, like eyes in worth, who nought concealing gladly give.


If he that shaped the world desires that men should begging go,
Through life's long course, let him a wanderer be and perish so.


Nothing is harder than the hardness that will say,
'The plague of penury by asking alms we'll drive away.'


Who ne'er consent to beg in utmost need, their worth
Has excellence of greatness that transcends the earth.


Nothing is sweeter than to taste the toil-won cheer,
Though mess of pottage as tasteless as the water clear.


E'en if a draught of water for a cow you ask,
Nought's so distasteful to the tongue as beggar's task.


One thing I beg of beggars all, 'If beg ye may,
Of those who hide their wealth, beg not, I pray.'


The fragile bark of beggary
Wrecked on denial's rock will lie.


The heart will melt away at thought of beggary,
With thought of stern repulse 'twill perish utterly.


E'en as he asks, the shamefaced asker dies;
Where shall his spirit hide who help denies?



The base resemble men in outward form, I ween;
But counterpart exact to them I've never seen.


Than those of grateful heart the base must luckier be,
Their minds from every anxious thought are free!


The base are as the Gods; they too
Do ever what they list to do!


When base men those behold of conduct vile,
They straight surpass them, and exulting smile.


Fear is the base man's virtue; if that fail,
Intense desire some little may avail.


The base are like the beaten drum; for, when they hear
The sound the secret out in every neighbour's ear.


From off their moistened hands no clinging grain they shake,
Unless to those with clenched fist their jaws who break.


The good to those will profit yield fair words who use;
The base, like sugar-cane, will profit those who bruise.


If neighbours clothed and fed he see, the base
Is mighty man some hidden fault to trace?


For what is base man fit, if griefs assail?
Himself to offer, there and then, for sale!




Goddess? or peafowl rare? She whose ears rich jewels wear,
Is she a maid of human kind? All wildered is my mind!


She of the beaming eyes, To my rash look her glance replies,
As if the matchless goddess' hand Led forth an armed band.


Death's form I formerly Knew not; but now 'tis plain to me;
He comes in lovely maiden's guise, With soul-subduing eyes.


In sweet simplicity, A woman's gracious form hath she;
But yet those eyes, that drink my life, Are with the form at strife!


The light that on me gleams, Is it death's dart? or eye's bright beams?
Or fawn's shy glance? All three appear In form of maiden here.


If cruel eye-brow's bow, Unbent, would veil those glances now;
The shafts that wound this trembling heart Her eyes no more would dart.


As veil o'er angry eyes Of raging elephant that lies,
The silken cincture's folds invest This maiden's panting breast.


Ah! woe is me! my might, That awed my foemen in the fight,
By lustre of that beaming brow Borne down, lies broken now!


Like tender fawn's her eye; Clothed on is she with modesty;
What added beauty can be lent; By alien ornament?


The palm-tree's fragrant wine, To those who taste yields joys divine;
But love hath rare felicity For those that only see!


A double witchery have glances of her liquid eye;
One glance is glance that brings me pain; the other heals again.


The furtive glance, that gleams one instant bright,
Is more than half of love's supreme delight.


She looked, and looking drooped her head:
On springing shoot of love 'its water shed!


I look on her: her eyes are on the ground the while:
I look away: she looks on me with timid smile.


She seemed to see me not; but yet the maid
Her love, by smiling side-long glance, betrayed.


Though with their lips affection they disown,
Yet, when they hate us not, 'tis quickly known.


The slighting words that anger feign, while eyes their love reveal.
Are signs of those that love, but would their love conceal.


I gaze, the tender maid relents the while;
And, oh the matchless grace of that soft smile!


The look indifferent, that would its love disguise,
Is only read aright by lovers' eyes.


When eye to answering eye reveals the tale of love,
All words that lips can say must useless prove.


All joys that senses five- sight, hearing, taste, smell, touch- can give,
In this resplendent armlets-bearing damsel live!


Disease and medicine antagonists we surely see;
This maid, to pain she gives, herself is remedy.


Than rest in her soft arms to whom the soul is giv'n,
Is any sweeter joy in his, the Lotus-eyed-one's heaven?


Withdraw, it burns; approach, it soothes the pain;
Whence did the maid this wondrous fire obtain?


In her embrace, whose locks with flowery wreaths are bound,
Each varied form of joy the soul can wish is found.


Ambrosia are the simple maiden's arms; when I attain
Their touch, my withered life puts forth its buds again!


As when one eats from household store, with kindly grace
Sharing his meal: such is this golden maid's embrace.


Sweet is the strict embrace of those whom fond affection binds,
Where no dissevering breath of discord entrance finds.


The jealous variance, the healing of the strife, reunion gained:
These are the fruits from wedded love obtained.


The more men learn, the more their lack of learning they detect;
'Tis so when I approach the maid with gleaming jewels decked.


O flower of the sensitive plant! than thee
More tender's the maiden beloved by me.


You deemed, as you saw the flowers, her eyes were as flowers, my soul,
That many may see; it was surely some folly that over you stole!


As tender shoot her frame; teeth, pearls; around her odours blend;
Darts are the eyes of her whose shoulders like the bambu bend.


The lotus, seeing her, with head demiss, the ground would eye,
And say, 'With eyes of her, rich gems who wears, we cannot vie.'


The flowers of the sensitive plant as a girdle around her she placed;
The stems she forgot to nip off; they 'll weigh down the delicate waist.


The stars perplexed are rushing wildly from their spheres;
For like another moon this maiden's face appears.


In moon, that waxing waning shines, as sports appear,
Are any spots discerned in face of maiden here?


Farewell, O moon! If that thine orb could shine
Bright as her face, thou shouldst be love of mine.


If as her face, whose eyes are flowers, thou wouldst have charms for me,
Shine for my eyes alone, O moon, shine not for all to see!


The flower of the sensitive plant, and the down on the swan's white breast,
As the thorn are harsh, by the delicate feet of this maiden pressed.


The dew on her white teeth, whose voice is soft and low,
Is as when milk and honey mingled flow.


Between this maid and me the friendship kind
Is as the bonds that soul and body bind.


For her with beauteous brow, the maid I love, there place is none;
To give her image room, O pupil of mine eye, begone!


Life is she to my very soul when she draws nigh;
Dissevered from the maid with jewels rare, I die!


I might recall, if I could once forget; but from my heart
Her charms fade not, whose eyes gleam like the warrior's dart.


My loved one's subtle form departs not from my eyes;
I wink them not, lest I should pain him where he lies.


My love doth ever in my eyes reside;
I stain them not, fearing his form to hide.


Within my heart my lover dwells; from food I turn
That smacks of heat, lest he should feel it burn.


I fear his form to hide, nor close my eyes:
'Her love estranged is gone!' the village cries.


Rejoicing in my very soul he ever lies;
'Her love estranged is gone far off!' the village cries.



To those who 've proved love's joy, and now afflicted mourn,
Except the helpful 'horse of palm', no other strength remains.


My body and my soul, that can no more endure,
Will lay reserve aside, and mount the 'horse of palm'.


I once retained reserve and seemly manliness;
To-day I nought possess but lovers' 'horse of palm'.


Love's rushing tide will sweep away the raft
Of seemly manliness and shame combined.


The maid that slender armlets wears, like flowers entwined,
Has brought me 'horse of palm,' and pangs of eventide!


Of climbing 'horse of palm' in midnight hour, I think;
My eyes know no repose for that same simple maid.


There's nought of greater worth than woman's long-enduring soul,
Who, vexed by love like ocean waves, climbs not the 'horse of palm'.


In virtue hard to move, yet very tender, too, are we;
Love deems not so, would rend the veil, and court publicity!


'There's no one knows my heart,' so says my love,
And thus, in public ways, perturbed will rove.


Before my eyes the foolish make a mock of me,
Because they ne'er endured the pangs I now must drie.


By this same rumour's rise, my precious life stands fast;
Good fortune grant the many know this not!


The village hath to us this rumour giv'n, that makes her mine;
Unweeting all the rareness of the maid with flower-like eyne.


The rumour spread within the town, is it not gain to me?
It is as though that were obtained that may not be.


The rumour rising makes my love to rise;
My love would lose its power and languish otherwise.


The more man drinks, the more he ever drunk would be;
The more my love's revealed, the sweeter 'tis to me!


I saw him but one single day: rumour spreads soon
As darkness, when the dragon seizes on the moon.


My anguish grows apace: the town's report
Manures it; my mother's word doth water it.


With butter-oil extinguish fire! 'Twill prove
Harder by scandal to extinguish love.


When he who said 'Fear not!' hath left me blamed,
While many shrink, can I from rumour hide ashamed?


If we desire, who loves will grant what we require;
This town sends forth the rumour we desire!



If you will say, 'I leave thee not,' then tell me so;
Of quick return tell those that can survive this woe.


It once was perfect joy to look upon his face;
But now the fear of parting saddens each embrace.


To trust henceforth is hard, if ever he depart,
E'en he, who knows his promise and my breaking heart.


If he depart, who fondly said, 'Fear not,' what blame's incurred
By those who trusted to his reassuring word?


If you would guard my life, from going him restrain
Who fills my life! If he depart, hardly we meet again.


To cherish longing hope that he should ever gracious be,
Is hard, when he could stand, and of departure speak to me.


The bracelet slipping from my wrist announced before
Departure of the Prince that rules the ocean shore.


'Tis sad to sojourn in the town where no kind kinsmen dwell;
'Tis sadder still to bid a friend beloved farewell.


Fire burns the hands that touch; but smart of love
Will burn in hearts that far away remove.


Sorrow's sadness meek sustaining, Driving sore distress away,
Separation uncomplaining Many bear the livelong day!


I would my pain conceal, but see! it surging swells,
As streams to those that draw from ever-springing wells.


I cannot hide this pain of mine, yet shame restrains
When I would tell it out to him who caused my pains.


My soul, like porter's pole, within my wearied frame,
Sustains a two-fold burthen poised, of love and shame.


A sea of love, 'tis true, I see stretched out before,
But not the trusty bark that wafts to yonder shore.


Who work us woe in friendship's trustful hour,
What will they prove when angry tempests lower?


A happy love 's sea of joy; but mightier sorrows roll
From unpropitious love athwart the troubled soul.


I swim the cruel tide of love, and can no shore descry,
In watches of the night, too, 'mid the waters, only I!


All living souls in slumber soft she steeps;
But me alone kind night for her companing keeps!


More cruel than the cruelty of him, the cruel one,
In these sad times are lengthening hours of night I watch alone.


When eye of mine would as my soul go forth to him,
It knows not how through floods of its own tears to swim.


They showed me him, and then my endless pain
I saw: why then should weeping eyes complain?


How glancing eyes, that rash unweeting looked that day,
With sorrow measureless are wasting now away!


The eyes that threw such eager glances round erewhile
Are weeping now. Such folly surely claims a smile!


Those eyes have wept till all the fount of tears is dry,
That brought upon me pain that knows no remedy.


The eye that wrought me more than sea could hold of woes,
Is suffering pangs that banish all repose.


Oho! how sweet a thing to see! the eye
That wrought this pain, in the same gulf doth lie.


Aching, aching, let those exhaust their stream,
That melting, melting, that day gazed on him.


Who loved me once, onloving now doth here remain;
Not seeing him, my eye no rest can gain.


When he comes not, all slumber flies; no sleep when he is there;
Thus every way my eyes have troubles hard to bear.


It is not hard for all the town the knowledge to obtain,
When eyes, as mine, like beaten tambours, make the mystery plain.


I willed my lover absent should remain;
Of pining's sickly hue to whom shall I complain?


'He gave': this sickly hue thus proudly speaks,
Then climbs, and all my frame its chariot makes.


Of comeliness and shame he me bereft,
While pain and sickly hue, in recompense, he left.


I meditate his words, his worth is theme of all I say,
This sickly hue is false that would my trust betray.


My lover there went forth to roam;
This pallor of my frame usurps his place at home.


As darkness waits till lamp expires, to fill the place,
This pallor waits till I enjoy no more my lord's embrace.


I lay in his embrace, I turned unwittingly;
Forthwith this hue, as you might grasp it, came on me.


On me, because I pine, they cast a slur;
But no one says, 'He first deserted her.'


Well! let my frame, as now, be sicklied o'er with pain,
If he who won my heart's consent, in good estate remain!


'Tis well, though men deride me for my sickly hue of pain;
If they from calling him unkind, who won my love, refrain.


The bliss to be beloved by those they love who gains,
Of love the stoneless, luscious fruit obtains.


As heaven on living men showers blessings from above,
Is tender grace by lovers shown to those they love.


Who love and are beloved to them alone
Belongs the boast, 'We've made life's very joys our own.'


Those well-beloved will luckless prove,
Unless beloved by those they love.


From him I love to me what gain can be,
Unless, as I love him, he loveth me?


Love on one side is bad; like balanced load
By porter borne, love on both sides is good.


While Kaman rushes straight at me alone,
Is all my pain and wasting grief unknown?


Who hear from lover's lips no pleasant word from day to day,
Yet in the world live out their life,- no braver souls than they!


Though he my heart desires no grace accords to me,
Yet every accent of his voice is melody.


Tell him thy pain that loves not thee?
Farewell, my soul, fill up the sea!


From thought of her unfailing gladness springs,
Sweeter than palm-rice wine the joy love brings.


How great is love! Behold its sweetness past belief!
Think on the lover, and the spirit knows no grief.


A fit of sneezing threatened, but it passed away;
He seemed to think of me, but do his fancies stray?


Have I a place within his heart!
From mine, alas! he never doth depart.


Me from his heart he jealously excludes:
Hath he no shame who ceaseless on my heart intrudes?


How live I yet? I live to ponder o'er
The days of bliss with him that are no more.


If I remembered not what were I then? And yet,
The fiery smart of what my spirit knows not to forget!


My frequent thought no wrath excites. It is not so?
This honour doth my love on me bestow.


Dear life departs, when his ungracious deeds I ponder o'er,
Who said erewhile, 'We're one for evermore'.


Set not; so may'st thou prosper, moon! that eyes may see
My love who went away, but ever bides with me.


It came and brought to me, that nightly vision rare,
A message from my love,- what feast shall I prepare?


If my dark, carp-like eye will close in sleep, as I implore,
The tale of my long-suffering life I'll tell my loved one o'er.


Him, who in waking hour no kindness shows,
In dreams I see; and so my lifetime goes!


Some pleasure I enjoy when him who loves not me
In waking hours, the vision searches out and makes me see.


As what I then beheld in waking hour was sweet,
So pleasant dreams in hour of sleep my spirit greet.


And if there were no waking hour, my love
In dreams would never from my side remove.


The cruel one, in waking hour, who all ungracious seems,
Why should he thus torment my soul in nightly dreams?


And when I sleep he holds my form embraced;
And when I wake to fill my heart makes haste!


In dreams who ne'er their lover's form perceive,
For those in waking hours who show no love will grieve.


They say, that he in waking hours has left me lone;
In dreams they surely see him not,- these people of the town;


Thou art not evening, but a spear that doth devour
The souls of brides; farewell, thou evening hour!


Thine eye is sad; Hail, doubtful hour of eventide!
Of cruel eye, as is my spouse, is too thy bride?


With buds of chilly dew wan evening's shade enclose;
My anguish buds space and all my sorrow grows.


When absent is my love, the evening hour descends,
As when an alien host to field of battle wends.


O morn, how have I won thy grace? thou bring'st relief
O eve, why art thou foe! thou dost renew my grief.


The pangs that evening brings I never knew,
Till he, my wedded spouse, from me withdrew.


My grief at morn a bud, all day an opening flower,
Full-blown expands in evening hour.


The shepherd's pipe is like a murderous weapon, to my ear,
For it proclaims the hour of ev'ning's fiery anguish near.


If evening's shades, that darken all my soul, extend;
From this afflicted town will would of grief ascend.


This darkening eve, my darkling soul must perish utterly;
Remembering him who seeks for wealth, but seeks not me.


Thine eyes grown dim are now ashamed the fragrant flow'rs to see,
Thinking on him, who wand'ring far, leaves us in misery.


The eye, with sorrow wan, all wet with dew of tears,
As witness of the lover's lack of love appears.


These withered arms, desertion's pangs abundantly display,
That swelled with joy on that glad nuptial day.


When lover went, then faded all their wonted charms,
And armlets' golden round slips off from these poor wasted arms.


These wasted arms, the bracelet with their wonted beauty gone,
The cruelty declare of that most cruel one.


I grieve, 'tis pain to me to hear him cruel chid,
Because the armlet from my wasted arm has slid.


My heart! say ought of glory wilt thou gain,
If to that cruel one thou of thy wasted arms complain?


One day the fervent pressure of embracing arms I checked,
Grew wan the forehead of the maid with golden armlet decked.


As we embraced a breath of wind found entrance there;
The maid's large liquid eyes were dimmed with care.


The dimness of her eye felt sorrow now,
Beholding what was done by that bright brow.


My heart, canst thou not thinking of some med'cine tell,
Not any one, to drive away this grief incurable?


Since he loves not, thy smart
Is folly, fare thee well my heart!


What comes of sitting here in pining thought, O heart? He knows
No pitying thought, the cause of all these wasting woes.


O rid me of these eyes, my heart; for they,
Longing to see him, wear my life away.


O heart, as a foe, can I abandon utterly
Him who, though I long for him, longs not for me?


My heart, false is the fire that burns; thou canst not wrath maintain,
If thou thy love behold, embracing, soothing all thy pain.


Or bid thy love, or bid thy shame depart;
For me, I cannot bear them both, my worthy heart!


Thou art befooled, my heart, thou followest him who flees from thee;
And still thou yearning criest: 'He will nor pity show nor love to me.'


My heart! my lover lives within my mind;
Roaming, whom dost thou think to find?


If I should keep in mind the man who utterly renounces me,
My soul must suffer further loss of dignity.



Of womanly reserve love's axe breaks through the door,
Barred by the bolt of shame before.


What men call love is the one thing of merciless power;
It gives my soul no rest, e'en in the midnight hour.


I would my love conceal, but like a sneeze
It shows itself, and gives no warning sign.


In womanly reserve I deemed myself beyond assail;
But love will come abroad, and casts away the veil.


The dignity that seeks not him who acts as foe,
Is the one thing that loving heart can never know.


My grief how full of grace, I pray you see!
It seeks to follow him that hateth me.


No sense of shame my gladdened mind shall prove,
When he returns my longing heart to bless with love.


The words of that deceiver, versed in every wily art,
Are instruments that break through every guard of woman's heart!


'I 'll shun his greeting'; saying thus with pride away I went:
I held him in my arms, for straight I felt my heart relent.


'We 'll stand aloof and then embrace': is this for them to say,
Whose hearts are as the fat that in the blaze dissolves away?


My eyes have lost their brightness, sight is dimmed; my fingers worn,
With nothing on the wall the days since I was left forlorn.


O thou with gleaming jewels decked, could I forget for this one day,
Henceforth these bracelets from my arms will slip, my beauty worn away.


On victory intent, His mind sole company he went;
And I yet life sustain! And long to see his face again!


'He comes again, who left my side, and I shall taste love's joy,'-
My heart with rapture swells, when thoughts like these my mind employ.


O let me see my spouse again and sate these longing eyes!
That instant from my wasted frame all pallor flies.


O let my spouse but come again to me one day!
I'll drink that nectar: wasting grief shall flee away.


Shall I draw back, or yield myself, or shall both mingled be,
When he returns, my spouse, dear as these eyes to me.


O would my king would fight, o'ercome, devide the spoil;
At home, to-night, the banquet spread should crown the toil.


One day will seem like seven to those who watch and yearn
For that glad day when wanderers from afar return.


What's my return, the meeting hour, the wished-for greeting worth,
If she heart-broken lie, with all her life poured forth?


Thou hid'st it, yet thine eye, disdaining all restraint,
Something, I know not, what, would utter of complaint.


The simple one whose beauty fills mine eye, whose shoulders curve
Like bambu stem, hath all a woman's modest sweet reserve.


As through the crystal beads is seen the thread on which they 're strung
So in her beauty gleams some thought cannot find a tongue.


As fragrance in the opening bud, some secret lies
Concealed in budding smile of this dear damsel's eyes.


The secret wiles of her with thronging armlets decked,
Are medicines by which my raising grief is checked.


While lovingly embracing me, his heart is only grieved:
It makes me think that I again shall live of love bereaved.


My severance from the lord of this cool shore,
My very armlets told me long before.


My loved one left me, was it yesterday?
Days seven my pallid body wastes away!


She viewed her tender arms, she viewed the armlets from them slid;
She viewed her feet: all this the lady did.


To show by eye the pain of love, and for relief to pray,
Is womanhood's most womanly device, men say.


Gladness at the thought, rejoicing at the sight,
Not palm-tree wine, but love, yields such delight.


When as palmyra tall, fulness of perfect love we gain,
Distrust can find no place small as the millet grain.


Although his will his only law, he lightly value me,
My heart knows no repose unless my lord I see.


My friend, I went prepared to show a cool disdain;
My heart, forgetting all, could not its love restrain.


The eye sees not the rod that paints it; nor can I
See any fault, when I behold my husband nigh.


When him I see, to all his faults I 'm blind;
But when I see him not, nothing but faults I find.


As those of rescue sure, who plunge into the stream,
So did I anger feign, though it must falsehood seem?


Though shameful ill it works, dear is the palm-tree wine
To drunkards; traitor, so to me that breast of thine!


Love is tender as an opening flower. In season due
To gain its perfect bliss is rapture known to few.


Her eye, as I drew nigh one day, with anger shone:
By love o'erpowered, her tenderness surpassed my own.


You see his heart is his alone
O heart, why not be all my own?


'Tis plain, my heart, that he 's estranged from thee;
Why go to him as though he were not enemy?


'The ruined have no friends, 'they say; and so, my heart,
To follow him, at thy desire, from me thou dost depart.


'See, thou first show offended pride, and then submit,' I bade;
Henceforth such council who will share with thee my heart?


I fear I shall not gain, I fear to lose him when I gain;
And thus my heart endures unceasing pain.


My heart consumes me when I ponder lone,
And all my lover's cruelty bemoan.


Fall'n 'neath the sway of this ignoble foolish heart,
Which will not him forget, I have forgotten shame.


If I contemn him, then disgrace awaits me evermore;
My soul that seeks to live his virtues numbers o'er.


And who will aid me in my hour of grief,
If my own heart comes not to my relief?


A trifle is unfriendliness by aliens shown,
When our own heart itself is not our own!


Be still reserved, decline his profferred love;
A little while his sore distress we 'll prove.


A cool reserve is like the salt that seasons well the mess,
Too long maintained, 'tis like the salt's excess.


'Tis heaping griefs on those whose hearts are grieved;
To leave the grieving one without a fond embrace.


To use no kind conciliating art when lover grieves,
Is cutting out the root of tender winding plant that droops.


Even to men of good and worthy mind, the petulance
Of wives with flowery eyes lacks not a lovely grace.


Love without hatred is ripened fruit;
Without some lesser strife, fruit immature.


A lovers' quarrel brings its pain, when mind afraid
Asks doubtful, 'Will reunion sweet be long delayed?'


What good can grieving do, when none who love
Are there to know the grief thy soul endures?


Water is pleasant in the cooling shade;
So coolness for a time with those we love.


Of her who leaves me thus in variance languishing,
To think within my heart with love is fond desire.



From thy regard all womankind Enjoys an equal grace;
O thou of wandering fickle mind, I shrink from thine embrace!


One day we silent sulked; he sneezed: The reason well I knew;
He thought that I, to speak well pleased, Would say, 'Long life to you!'


I wreathed with flowers one day my brow, The angry tempest lowers;
She cries, 'Pray, for what woman now Do you put on your flowers?'


'I love you more than all beside,' 'T was thus I gently spoke;
'What all, what all?' she instant cried; And all her anger woke.


'While here I live, I leave you not,' I said to calm her fears.
She cried, 'There, then, I read your thought'; And straight dissolved in tears.


'Each day I called to mind your charms,' 'O, then, you had forgot,'
She cried, and then her opened arms, Forthwith embraced me not.


She hailed me when I sneezed one day; But straight with anger seized,
She cried; 'Who was the woman, pray, Thinking of whom you sneezed?'


And so next time I checked my sneeze; She forthwith wept and cried,
(That woman difficult to please), 'Your thoughts from me you hide'.


I then began to soothe and coax, To calm her jealous mind;
'I see', quoth she, 'to other folks How you are wondrous kind'


I silent sat, but thought the more, And gazed on her. Then she
Cried out, 'While thus you eye me o'er, Tell me whose form you see'.


Although there be no fault in him, the sweetness of his love
Hath power in me a fretful jealousy to move.


My 'anger feigned' gives but a little pain;
And when affection droops, it makes it bloom again.


Is there a bliss in any world more utterly divine,
Than 'coyness' gives, when hearts as earth and water join?


'Within the anger feigned' that close love's tie doth bind,
A weapon lurks, which quite breaks down my mind.


Though free from fault, from loved one's tender arms
To be estranged a while hath its own special charms.


'Tis sweeter to digest your food than 'tis to eat;
In love, than union's self is anger feigned more sweet.


In lovers' quarrels, 'tis the one that first gives way,
That in re-union's joy is seen to win the day.


And shall we ever more the sweetness know of that embrace
With dewy brow; to which 'feigned anger' lent its piquant grace.


Let her, whose jewels brightly shine, aversion feign!
That I may still plead on, O night, prolong thy reign!


A 'feigned aversion' coy to pleasure gives a zest;
The pleasure's crowned when breast is clasped to breast.
