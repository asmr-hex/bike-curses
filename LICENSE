Malediction

I thought it ﬁtting in a work such as this to include the negative
equivalent of thanks, namely a curse. It should be apparent that con-
siderable effort and expense went into preparing this book. Unfonu-
nately. copyright violators are daily making such ventures more and
mare impractical So I will repeat the words of I’seudn-Alhertus, 'lnas-
much as, at this juncture, all looks so gloomy in society, the writer of
this experts that no pirate of books will wmngfully seize this work and
reprint the same, if such an one does not wish to incur the eternal
curse, and even condemnation from such an ad While we recum-
mend it to the protection of God and the Holy Trinity, that they may
be watching the same, and set the Angel Michael as watch and guard
over the undenaking, so that no pirate may rob the real and legal
owner of the means of deriving his daily bread from the sale of this
publication, and cheat him of his property by the peril of losing his
hlessedness, such a being would never ﬁnd rest nor quiet, by day or
night, neither here below nor in the hereafter, by seeking to defraud
the publisher of his 0an 'lhis would God the Father, Son, and Holy
Spirit grant.”

I will add that special dishonor belongs to certain evil and loath-
some ll’ trolls, who try to boost their egos by populating their websites
with material pilfered {mm the hard work of uthers. May the devils
continue to punish them until they ﬁnally carry them away to hell.
